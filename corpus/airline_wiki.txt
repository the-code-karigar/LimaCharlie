cabins were often spacious with luxurious interiors   over speed and efficiency  The relatively basic navigational capabilities of pilots at the time also meant that delays due to the weather were commonplace       Rationalization edit  The Imperial Airways Empire Terminal  Victoria  London  Trains ran from here to flying boats in Southampton  and to Croydon Airport  By the early     s  small airlines were struggling to compete  and there was a movement towards increased rationalization and consolidation  In       Imperial Airways was formed from the merger of Instone Air Line Company  British Marine Air Navigation  Daimler Airway and Handley Page Transport  to allow British airlines to compete with stiff competition from French and German airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies  The airline was a pioneer in surveying and opening up air routes across the world to serve far flung parts of the British Empire and to enhance trade and integration      The first new airliner ordered by Imperial Airways  was the Handley Page W f City of Washington  delivered on   November           In the first year of operation the company carried        passengers and         letters  In April       the film The Lost World became the first film to be screened for passengers on a scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the London Paris route  Two French airlines also merged to form Air Union on   January       This later merged with four other French airlines to become Air France  the country s flagship carrier to this day  on    May           Germany s Deutsche Lufthansa was created in      by merger of two airlines  one of them Junkers Luftverkehr  Lufthansa  due to the Junkers heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time  became a

merged into Air France      Although Germany lacked colonies  it also began expanding its services globally  In       the airship Graf Zeppelin began offering regular scheduled passenger service between Germany and South America  usually every two weeks  which continued until           In       the airship Hindenburg entered passenger service and successfully crossed the Atlantic    times

 Deutsche Lufthansa operated an airmail service from Stuttgart  Germany via Spain  the Canary Islands and West Africa to Natal in Brazil  This was the first time an airline flew across an ocean          By the end of the     s Aeroflot had become the world s largest airline  employing more than       pilots and        other service personnel and operating around       aircraft  of which     were considered obsolete by its own standards   During the Soviet era Aeroflot was synonymous with Russian civil aviation  as it was the only air carrier  It became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on    September      with the Tupolev Tu           Deregulation edit  Deregulation of the European Union airspace in the early     s has had substantial effect on the structure of the industry there  The shift towards  budget  airlines on shorter routes has been significant  Airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair have often grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines  There has also been a trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatized such as has occurred for Aer Lingus and British Airways  Other national airlines

closure in                   Following World War I  the United States found itself swamped with aviators  Many decided to take their war surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns  performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds  In       the United States Post Office Department won the financial backing of Congress to begin experimenting with air mail service  initially using Curtiss Jenny     aircraft that had been procured by the United States Army Air Service  Private operators were the first to fly the mail but due to numerous accidents the US Army was tasked with mail delivery  During the Army s involvement they proved to be too unreliable and lost their air mail duties      By the mid     s  the Post Office had developed its own air mail network  based on a transcontinental backbone between New York City and San Francisco      To supplement this service  they offered twelve contracts for spur routes to independent bidders  Some of the carriers that won these routes would  through time and mergers  evolve into Pan Am  Delta Air Lines  Braniff Airways  American Airlines  United Airlines  originally a division of Boeing   Trans World Airlines  Northwest Airlines  and Eastern Air Lines  Service during the early     s was sporadic  most airlines at the time were focused on carrying bags of mail  In       however  the Ford Motor Company bought out the Stout Aircraft Company and began construction of the all metal Ford Trimotor  which became the first successful American airliner  With a    passenger capacity  the Trimotor made passenger service potentially profitable      Air service was seen as a supplement to rail service in the American transportation network  At the same time  Juan Trippe began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world  and he achieved this goal through his airline  Pan Am  with a fleet of flying boats that linked Los Angeles to Shanghai and Boston to London  Pan Am and Northwest Airways  which

Export Airlines  the first airline to offer landplane flights across the North Atlantic in October           World War II  like World War I  brought new life to the airline industry  Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military  and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport  for both passengers and cargo  They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the Boeing Stratocruiser  Lockheed Constellation  and Douglas DC    Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the B     which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as pressurization  Most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload          In the     s  the De Havilland Comet  Boeing      Douglas DC    and Sud Aviation Caravelle became the first flagships of the Jet Age in the West  while the Eastern bloc had Tupolev Tu     and Tupolev Tu     in the fleets of state owned carriers such

Neptune s Car in       The deregulation of the American airline industry increased the financial troubles of the airline which ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December           The      U S  airline industry deregulation lowered federally controlled barriers for new airlines just as a downturn in the nation s economy occurred  New start ups entered during the downturn  during which time they found aircraft and funding  contracted hangar and maintenance services  trained new employees  and recruited laid off staff from other airlines  Major airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings  often swamping new start ups  In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation  the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called loss leader pricing      In this strategy an already established and dominant airline stomps out its competition by lowering airfares on specific routes  below the cost of operating on it  choking out any chance a start up airline may have  The industry side effect is an overall drop in revenue and service quality      Since deregulation in      the average domestic ticket price has dropped by          So has airline employee pay  After incurring massive losses  the airlines of the USA relied upon Chapter    bankruptcy proceedings to continue doing business      America West Airlines  which has since merged with US Airways  remained a significant survivor from this new entrant era  as dozens  even hundreds  have gone under  In many ways  the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger  Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation  indeed the U S  witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel  Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers  even joining frequent flyer loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying  New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city  do business  and return the same day  from almost any point in the country  Air travel s advantages put long distance intercity railroad travel and bus lines under pressure  with most of the latter having withered away  whilst the former is still protected under nationalization through the continuing existence of Amtrak  By the     s  almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U S   and today the domestic industry operates over        daily departures nationwide  Toward the end of the century  a new style of low cost airline emerged  offering a no frills product at a lower price  Southwest Airlines  JetBlue  AirTran Airways  Skybus Airlines and other low cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so called  legacy airlines   as did their low cost counterparts in many other countries      Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers  However  of these  ATA and Skybus have since ceased operations  Increasingly since       US airlines have been reincorporated and spun off by newly created and internally led management companies  and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control  Among some of these holding companies and parent companies which are relatively well known  are the UAL Corporation  along with the AMR Corporation  among a long list of airline holding companies sometime recognized worldwide  Less recognized are the private equity firms which often seize managerial  financial  and board of directors control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of capital in air carriers  to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or liquidating an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations  citation needed  Thus the last    years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable  to devastatingly depressed  As the first major market to deregulate the industry in       U S  airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region  In fact  no U S  legacy carrier survived bankruptcy free  Among the outspoken critics of deregulation  former CEO of American Airlines  Robert Crandall has publicly stated   Chapter    bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was a mistake        Bailout edit  Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act  P L          in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the September    attacks  Through the ATSB Congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through December           as a result of the terrorist attacks  This resulted in the first government bailout of the   st century      Between      and      US airlines lost     billion with wage cuts of over     billion and         employees laid off      In recognition of the essential national economic role of a healthy aviation system  Congress authorized partial compensation of up to    billion in cash subject to review by the U S  Department of Transportation and up to     billion in loan guarantees subject to review by a newly created Air Transportation Stabilization Board  ATSB   The applications to DOT for reimbursements were subjected to rigorous multi year reviews not only by DOT program personnel but also by the Government Accountability Office     and the DOT Inspector General          Ultimately  the federal government provided      billion in one time  subject to income tax cash payments to     U S  air carriers  with no provision for repayment  essentially a gift from the taxpayers   Passenger carriers operating scheduled service received approximately    billion  subject to tax       In addition  the ATSB approved loan guarantees to six airlines totaling approximately      billion  Data from the U S  Treasury Department show that the government recouped the      billion and a profit of      million from the fees  interest and purchase of discounted airline stock associated with loan guarantees      As of May      update  the four largest major carriers

Airways  UK s flag carrier Many countries have national airlines that the government owns and operates  Fully private airlines are subject to much government regulation for economic  political  and safety concerns  For instance  governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions to protect the free flow of people  communications  and goods between different regions without compromising safety  The United States  Australia  and to a lesser extent Brazil  Mexico  India  the United Kingdom  and Japan have  deregulated  their airlines  In the past  these governments dictated airfares  route networks  and other operational requirements for each airline  Since deregulation  airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports  enter and exit routes easily  and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand  The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market  and so the U S  has seen hundreds of airlines start up  sometimes for only a brief operating period   This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets  The added competition  together with pricing freedom  means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that  to a limited degree  full service airlines must match  This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers  which tend to have a higher cost base  As a result  profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines  These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business  in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants  In the United States  the airline industry is dominated by four large firms  Because of industry consolidation  after fuel prices dropped considerably in       very little of the savings were passed on to consumers       International edit  International Civil Aviation Organization headquarters in Montreal Groups such as the International Civil Aviation Organization establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns  Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries  which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes  The model of such an agreement was the Bermuda Agreement between the US and UK following World War II  which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes  Bilateral agreements are based on the  freedoms of the air   a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country  a very rarely granted right known as cabotage   Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country  some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country  or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas  In the     s   open skies  agreements became more common  These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition  Open skies agreements have met some criticism  particularly within the European Union  whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States  because of cabotage restrictions   Economy edit  This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in

Analysis of the           period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines  who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales

 Delta Air Lines  Northwest Airlines  Pan Am  United Airlines and US Airways  twice   Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport  then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus  or  hub   for its scheduled flights  Fuel hedging is a contractual tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs  Several low cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines adopt this practice  Southwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between      and the early     s due to its fuel hedging policy  Many other airlines are replicating Southwest s hedging policy to control their fuel costs      Operating costs for US major airlines are primarily aircraft operating expense including jet fuel  aircraft maintenance  depreciation and aircrew for      servicing expense for      traffic      passenger     and aircraft          for reservations and sales and     for overheads  administration    and advertising      An average US major Boeing         flies       miles        km  stages      block hours per day and costs

ASM      McKinsey observes that  newer technology  larger aircraft  and increasingly efficient operations continually drive down the cost of running an airline   from nearly    US cents per ASK at the beginning of the jet age  to just above    cents since       Those improvements were passed onto the customer due to high competition  fares have been falling throughout the history of airlines       Revenue edit  Diagram of an airline Global Distribution System Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability  The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized yield management systems  Because of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability  airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler  Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public  so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments  Most airlines use differentiated pricing  a form of price discrimination  to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments  Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure  the booked load factor  the forecast of total demand by price point  competitive pricing in force  and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day  Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft  first  business and economy  into a number of travel classes for pricing purposes  A complicating factor is that of origin destination control   O D control    Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney  as an example  for A     is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight  and who is willing to pay A       Should the airline prefer the       passenger  or the      passenger plus a possible Sydney Los Angeles passenger willing to pay        Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily  The advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late     s  most notably Sabre  allowed airlines to easily perform cost benefit analyses on different pricing structures  leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases  that is  filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere   The intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term  fare war  to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes  Through computers  new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines  sales channels  For this purpose the airlines use the Airline Tariff Publishing Company  ATPCO   who distribute latest fares for more than     airlines to Computer Reservation Systems across the world  The extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in  legacy  carriers  In contrast  low fare carriers usually offer pre announced and simplified price structure  and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately  Computers also allow airlines to predict  with some accuracy  how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly  This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for  no shows   but not enough  in most cases  to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats  stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with overbooking on high demand flights can help reduce this figure  This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand      Over January February       the cheapest airline surveyed by price comparator rome rio was now defunct Tigerair Australia with       km followed by AirAsia X with       km  while the most expensive was Charterlines  Inc  with       km followed by Buddha Air with       km       For the IATA  the global airline industry revenue was      billion in      for a       billion collective profit  and should rise by       to      billion in      for a       billion profit forecast  down by     due to rising jet fuel and labor costs       The demand for air transport will be less elastic for longer flights than for shorter flights  and more elastic for leisure travel than for business travel       Airlines often have a strong seasonality  with traffic low in winter and peaking in summer  In Europe the most extreme market are the Greek islands with July August having more than ten times the winter traffic  as Jet  is the most seasonal among low cost carriers with July having seven times the January traffic  whereas legacy carriers are much less with only         variability        Assets and financing edit  The  Golden Lounge  of Malaysia Airlines at Kuala Lumpur International Airport  KLIA   Airline financing is quite complex  since airlines are highly leveraged operations  Not only must they purchase  or lease  new airliner bodies and engines regularly  they must make major long term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain  comparably Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type  the Boeing     and derivatives   with the now defunct Eastern Air Lines which operated    different aircraft types  each with varying pilot  engine  maintenance  and support needs  A second financial issue is that of hedging oil and fuel purchases  which are usually second only to labor in its relative cost to the company  However  with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline  Legacy airlines  compared with new entrants  have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older  less fuel efficient aircraft      While hedging instruments can be expensive  they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs  such as in the           period  In view of the congestion apparent at many international airports  the ownership of slots at certain airports  the right to take off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night  has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines  Clearly take off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline s flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline  If a particular city has two or more airports  market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes  or those on which competition is weakest  to the less congested airport  where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper  For example  Reagan National Airport attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion  leaving less profitable routes to Baltimore Washington International Airport and Dulles International Airport       Other factors  such as surface transport facilities and onward connections  will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway  For example  LaGuardia Airport is the preferred airport for most of Manhattan due to its proximity  while long distance routes must use John F  Kennedy International Airport s longer runways   Airline alliances edit  Main article  Airline alliance The first airline alliance was formed in the     s when Pan Am and its subsidiary  Panair do Brasil  agreed to codeshare routes in Latin America when they overlapped with each other  citation needed  The   major airline alliances and the current fleet size of their home carriers  excluding subsidiaries  cargo and connecting partners  as of September         Star Alliance   SkyTeam   Oneworld Codesharing involves one airline selling tickets for another airline s flights under its own airline code  An early example of this was Japan Airlines   JAL  codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the     s on Tokyo Moscow flights  Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft  but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights   citation needed Another example was the Austrian Sabena partnership on the Vienna Brussels New York JFK route during the late    s  using a Sabena Boeing     with Austrian livery  citation needed  Since airline reservation requests are often made by city pair  such as  show me flights from Chicago to D sseldorf    an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago D sseldorf flight  The passenger is advised however  that airline no    operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam  for example   and airline no    operates the continuing flight  on a different airplane  sometimes from another terminal  to D sseldorf  Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one s service offerings in city pair terms to increase sales  A more recent development is the airline alliance  which became prevalent in the late     s  These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions  The largest are Star Alliance  SkyTeam and Oneworld  and these accounted for over     of global commercial air traffic as of      update        Alliances of airlines coordinate their passenger service programs  such as lounges and frequent flyer programs   offer special interline tickets and often engage in extensive codesharing  sometimes systemwide   These are increasingly integrated business combinations sometimes including cross equity arrangements in which products  service standards  schedules  and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency  One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was KLM  who partnered with Northwest Airlines  Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the fusion of KLM and Air France in       Often the companies combine IT operations  or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power  However  the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services  such as fuel  Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors  If an airline s main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners  then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses   Largest airlines edit  Main article  World s largest airlines The world s largest airlines can be defined in several ways  As of      update   American Airlines Group was the largest by fleet size  passengers carried and revenue passenger mile  Delta Air Lines was the largest by revenue  assets value and market capitalization  Lufthansa Group was the largest by number of employees  FedEx Express by freight tonne kilometres  Turkish Airlines by number of countries served and UPS Airlines by number of destinations served       though United Airlines was the largest passenger airline by number of destinations served              State support edit  Historically  air travel has survived largely through state support  whether in the form of equity or subsidies  The airline industry as a whole has made a cumulative loss during its     year history            One argument is that positive externalities  such as higher growth due to global mobility  outweigh the microeconomic losses and justify continuing government intervention  A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport  such as highways and railways  both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world  Although many countries continue to operate state owned or parastatal airlines  many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit       In December       the collapse of Pan Am  an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry  highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies  Following the      deregulation  U S  carriers did not manage to make an aggregate profit for    years in     including four years where combined losses amounted to     billion  but rebounded with eight consecutive years of profits since       including its four with over     billion profits  They drop loss making routes  avoid fare wars and market share battles  limit capacity growth  add hub feed with regional jets to increase their profitability  They change schedules to create more connections  buy used aircraft  reduce international frequencies and leverage partnerships to optimize capacities and benefit from overseas connectivity       Environment edit  Main article  Environmental impact of aviation MODIS tracking of contrails generated by air traffic over the southeastern United States on    January       Aircraft engines emit noise pollution  gases and particulate emissions  and contribute to global dimming       Growth of the industry in recent years raised a number of ecological questions  Domestic air transport grew in China at      percent annually from      to       The rate of air travel globally increased at     percent per year over the same time  In the EU greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by     between      and            However it must be compared with the flights increase  only in UK  between      and      terminal passengers increased from         thousands to         thousands        according to AEA reports every year      million passengers travel by European airlines  which also share     of merchandise value in and out of Europe       Without even pressure from  green activists   targeting lower ticket prices  generally  airlines do what is possible to cut the fuel consumption  and gas emissions connected therewith   Further  according to some reports  it can be concluded that the last piston powered aircraft were as fuel efficient as the average jet in            Despite continuing efficiency improvements from the major aircraft manufacturers  the expanding demand for global air travel has resulted in growing greenhouse gas  GHG  emissions  Currently  the aviation sector  including US domestic and global international travel  make approximately     percent of global anthropogenic GHG emissions per annum  North America accounts for nearly    percent of the world s GHG emissions from aviation fuel use       CO  emissions from the jet fuel burned per passenger on an average       kilometers        mi  airline flight is about     kilograms      pounds        Loss of natural habitat potential associated with the jet fuel burned per passenger on a       kilometers        mi  airline flight is estimated to be     square meters       square feet        In the context of climate change and peak oil  there is a debate about possible taxation of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an emissions trading scheme  with a view to ensuring that the total external costs of aviation are taken into account       The airline industry is responsible for about    percent of greenhouse gases emitted by the U S  transportation sector  Boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flight related greenhouse gas emissions by    to    percent  The solution would be blending algae fuels with existing jet fuel        Boeing and Air New Zealand are collaborating with leading Brazilian biofuel maker Tecbio  New Zealand s Aquaflow Bionomic and other jet biofuel developers around the world  Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Green Fund are looking into the technology as part of a biofuel initiative       KLM has made the first commercial flight with biofuel in       There are projects on electric aircraft  and some of which are fully operational as of        Call signs edit  Main article  Aviation call signs Each operator of a scheduled or charter flight uses an airline call sign when communicating with airports or air traffic control  Most of these call signs are derived from the airline s trade name  but for reasons of history  marketing  or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English  so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft   some airlines and air forces use call signs less obviously connected with their trading name  For example  British Airways uses a Speedbird call sign  named after the logo of one of its predecessors  BOAC  while SkyEurope used Relax   Personnel edit  The aircrew of a Jetstar Boeing     The various types of airline personnel include flight crew  responsible for the operation of the aircraft  Flight crew members include  pilots  captain and first officer  some older aircraft also required a flight engineer and or a navigator   flight attendants  led by a purser on larger aircraft   In flight security personnel on some airlines  most notably El Al  Groundcrew  responsible for operations at airports  include Aerospace and avionics engineers responsible for certifying the aircraft for flight and management of aircraft maintenance  Aerospace engineers  responsible for airframe  powerplant and electrical systems maintenance  Avionics engineers responsible for avionics and instruments maintenance  Airframe and powerplant technicians  Electric System technicians  responsible for maintenance of electrical systems  Flight dispatchers  Baggage handlers  Ramp Agents  Remote centralized weight and balancing       Gate agents  Ticket agents  Passenger service agents  such as airline lounge employees   Reservation agents  usually  but not always  at facilities outside the airport  Crew schedulers  Airlines follow a corporate structure where each broad area of operations  such as maintenance  flight operations  including flight safety   and passenger service  is supervised by a vice president  Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the airline s hubs as well  Airlines employ lawyers to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks        Trends edit  Map of scheduled airline traffic in      Aircraft of various airlines parked side by side at Tokyo Narita Airport  Japan The pattern of ownership has been privatized since the mid     s  that is  the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations  This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non government ownership  in steps that are usually decades apart  This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions       Many major airlines operating between the     s and     s were government owned or government established  However  most airlines from the earliest days of air travel in the     s and     s were personal businesses     Growth rates are not consistent in all regions  but countries with a deregulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom  This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth  The U S   Australia  Canada  Japan  Brazil  India and other markets exhibit this trend  The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance  Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement  But profitability even in the good years is generally low  in the range of      net profit after interest and tax  In times of profit  airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand  Since       the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times  Conversely  in bad times losses can be dramatically worse  Warren Buffett in      said  the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country s airline companies was zero  Absolutely zero        As in many mature industries  consolidation is a trend  Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships  long term  multi faceted alliances between carriers  equity arrangements  mergers  or takeovers       Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries  most consolidation takes place within a country  In the U S   over     airlines have merged  been taken over  or gone out of business since the Airline Deregulation Act in       Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency  citation needed   Types edit  Passenger airlines can be grouped into various types  for example   Mainline airlines operate flights by the airline s main operating unit  rather than by regional affiliates or subsidiaries  Regional airlines  non  mainline  airlines that operate regional aircraft  regionals typically operate over shorter non intercontinental distances  often as feeder services for legacy mainline networks  Low cost carriers  giving a  basic    no frills  and perceived inexpensive service  Business class airline  an airline aimed at the business traveler  featuring all business class seating and amenities  Charter airlines  operating outside regular schedule intervals  Flag carriers  the historically nationally owned airlines that were considered representative of the country overseas  Legacy carriers  US carriers that predate the Airline Deregulation Act of       Major airlines of the United States  airlines with at least    billion in revenues  In addition  there are several cargo only airlines  This can involve specialized aircraft  like those with large cargo doors and reinforced floors  or modifying passenger planes for cargo only flights  During the COVID    pandemic  some passenger airlines temporarily converted their planes for cargo only flights to meet increased demand for freight transport             See also edit   Air charter Air ferry Airline

airports usually contain more runways and terminals  Airport distribution as of      Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru  India Sim n Bol var International Airport in Santa Marta  Colombia  Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok  Thailand Terminal B of Denver International Airport in Denver  United States An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities  mostly for commercial air transport        They usually consist of a landing area  which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land    or a helipad     and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers  hangars    and terminals  to maintain and monitor aircraft  Larger airports may have airport aprons  taxiway bridges  air traffic control centres  passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges  and emergency services  In some countries  the US in particular  airports also typically have one or more fixed base operators  serving general aviation  Airport operations are extremely complex  with a complicated system of aircraft support services  passenger services  and aircraft control services contained within the operation  Thus airports can be major employers  as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit  Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery  a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports  in order to reduce hazards  Additionally  airports have major local environmental impacts  as both large sources of air pollution  noise pollution and other environmental impacts  making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation  Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather  climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters   Commercial jets wait for the    AM hold  to pass before departing from John Wayne Airport in Orange County  Santa Ana   California  on February           Terminology edit  Air bridges at Oslo Gardermoen Airport captured from an Icelandair Boeing         The terms aerodrome  airfield  and airstrip also refer to airports  and the terms heliport  seaplane base  and STOLport refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters  seaplanes  and short take off and landing aircraft   Aerial view of Hong Kong s old Kai Tak Airport  taken the day after the airport closed In colloquial use in certain environments  the terms airport and aerodrome are often interchanged  However  in general  the term airport may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved  In some jurisdictions  airport is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements     That is to say  all airports are aerodromes  but not all aerodromes are airports  In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between aerodrome and airport  which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision  In US technical legal usage  landing area is used instead of aerodrome  and airport means  a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo       Types of airports edit  Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest in the world This section is empty   You can help by adding to it    March       Management edit  Smaller or less developed airfields  which represent the vast majority  often have a single runway shorter than       m        ft   Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of       m        ft  or longer  Skyline Airport in Inkom  Idaho  has a runway that is only     m      ft  long     As of      update   the CIA stated that there were approximately         airports or airfields recognizable from the air  around the world  including        in the US  the US having the most in the world          Airport ownership and operation edit  Many US airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms  who operate functions such as retail management and parking  All US commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA     under the Code of Federal Regulations Title    Part       Certification of Commercial Service Airports        Airport funding edit  The Airport   Airway Trust Fund  AATF  was created by the Airport and Airway Development in      which finances aviation programs in the United States      Airport Improvement Program  AIP   Facilities and Equipment  F E   and Research  Engineering  and Development  RE D  are the three major accounts of Federal Aviation Administration which are financed by the AATF  as well as pays for the FAA s Operation and Maintenance  O M  account      The funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues  Passenger tickets  fuel  and cargo tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts       Airport revenue edit  Airports revenues are divided into three major parts  aeronautical revenue  non aeronautical revenue  and non operating revenue  Aeronautical revenue makes up     in       from     and     in      and       non aeronautical revenue makes up               in previous years   and non operating revenue makes up               of the total revenue of airports       Aeronautical revenue edit  Aeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing  passenger service  parking  and hangar fees  Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property      Landing fees are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and charge extra for extra weight      Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports  Aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there      Every airport has its own rates of parking  for example  John F Kennedy airport in New York City charges     per hour for a plane of         pounds and the price increases with weight       Non aeronautical revenue edit  Non aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations  It includes lease revenue from compatible land use development  non aeronautical building leases  retail and concession sales  rental car operations  parking and in airport advertising      Concession revenue is one big part of non aeronautical revenue airports make through duty free  bookstores  restaurants and money exchange      Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports  as more people use the parking facilities of the airport  O Hare International Airport in Chicago charges    per hour for every car       Price regulation edit  Many airports are local monopolies  To prevent them from abusing their market power  governments regulate how much airports may charge to airlines  using price cap regulation           Landside and airside areas edit   Airside  redirects here  For other uses  see Airside  disambiguation   Airports are divided into landside and airside zones  The landside is subject to fewer special laws and is part of the public

traffic control edit  Main article  Air traffic control Airport Tower  Kempegowda International Airport Air traffic controllers on the ground help direct aircraft through a region of airspace  communicating with aircraft to coordinate their paths   Their tasks include maintaining a safe distance between aircraft  avoiding congestion  and rerouting aircraft to deal with adverse weather       Most air traffic control centers can be divided into terminal control centers  which control the small  highly used region around an airport  and area control centers  which control aircraft en route to their destinations in a larger area        Both terminal and area control centers use radio to communicate with pilots and radar to track their paths  and in terminal control centers visual observation can also be used  as most aircraft near a terminal control center are either taking off or landing     Ground control edit  This section is empty   You can help by adding to it    March

Maintenance management edit  Like industrial equipment or facility management  airports require tailor made maintenance management due to their complexity  With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments  these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service      To manage these airport assets  several solutions are competing for the market  CMMS  computerized maintenance management system  predominate  and mainly enable a company s maintenance activity to be monitored

India  the world s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy  Runway at S o Paulo Congonhas Airport in Brazil Further information  Environmental impact of aviation Aircraft noise is a major cause of noise disturbance to residents living near airports  Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights  Aircraft noise occurs not only from take offs and landings but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft  Noise can have other health effects as well  Other noises and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading to the airport      The construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports  is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside  historical sites  and local flora and fauna  Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft  large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds      The construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns  For example  because they often flatten out large areas  they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms  In addition  they generally replace trees and grass with pavement  they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas  leading to more flooding  run off and erosion in the surrounding land      citation needed   Airports are often built on low lying coastal land  globally     airports are at risk of coastal flooding now      A temperature rise of    C   consistent with the Paris Agreement   would lead to     airports being below mean sea level and     airports at risk of flooding      If global mean temperature rise exceeds this then as many as     airports will be at risk by       leading to major disruptions without appropriate adaptation      A      report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US Transportation Research Board showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas  GHG  reduction initiatives  Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a proving ground for their feasibility  Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs      A growing number of airports are installing solar photovoltaic arrays to offset their electricity use          The National Renewable Energy Lab has shown this can be done safely      This can also be done on the roofs of the airports and it has been found that the solar panels on these buildings work more effectively when compared to residential panels      clarification needed  The world s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at Kochi  India          As a part of their sustainability efforts  more and more airports are starting to explore the consequences of more electric aircraft coming into service  Electric aircraft require much energy  operating    small    passenger short range battery electric aircraft would demand at least    GWh year      and with short turnaround times between different flights  the charging powers have to be substantial  To tackle these issues  more airports are starting to look into alternative energy production such as solar power and wind power  but also how to use airport areas for biomass production          Another solution investigated is to use energy storage to charge during the night and use to charge the aircraft during daytime           Airport hygiene and public health concerns edit  Airports  as major international travel hubs  have the potential to be significant transmission points for infectious diseases  A notable study conducted during the peak of the           flu season at Helsinki Vantaa airport in Finland revealed that commonly touched surfaces in airports  especially the plastic security screening trays  are highly susceptible to contamination by respiratory viruses  These trays are touched by hundreds of passengers daily and  being made of plastic  a non porous material  provide an environment where viruses can survive for extended periods  In comparison  bathroom surfaces in the same airport tested negative for respiratory viruses  possibly indicating a heightened awareness of hygiene in these spaces          Hand hygiene plays a pivotal role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases in airports  Research indicates that only about     of individuals wash their hands after using the toilet  and of those  only     do so correctly  In airport settings  just one in five individuals maintain clean hands defined as washing with soap for at least    seconds in the preceding hour  Given the frequent touching of shared surfaces in airports  such as trays  railings  and touch panels  this poses a significant risk for disease transmission  A study from the University of Cyprus and MIT used models and simulations to demonstrate that increasing hand cleanliness from     to     in all airports could reduce the potential global impact of a disease by      If cleanliness levels reached      this impact could decrease by      Focusing on just the top    most influential airports for disease spread  enhancing hand hygiene practices could still significantly reduce disease transmission rates from     to      The findings underscore the importance of promoting hand washing in airports as a key measure in preventing the global spread of diseases            Military air base edit  Main article  Air base Fighter aircraft at an airbase in Lithuania This section is empty   You can help by adding to it    March       Airport designation

Service to direct pilots of aircraft  Air traffic  redirects here  For the Canadian band  see Air Traffic Control  band   For the Owl City song  see Maybe I m Dreaming  This article is about civilian direction of aircraft  For other types of aircraft control  see Air control    The air traffic control tower of Mumbai International Airport in India Air traffic control  ATC  is a service provided by ground based air traffic controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and through controlled airspace  The primary purpose of ATC is to prevent collisions  organise and expedite the flow of air traffic  and provide information and other support for pilots     In some countries  ATC can also provide advisory services to aircraft in non controlled airspace   Controllers monitor the location of aircraft in their assigned airspace using radar and communicate with pilots by radio     To prevent collisions  ATC enforces traffic separation rules  which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of empty space around it  ATC services are provided to all types of aircraft  including private  military  and commercial flights     Depending on the type of flight and the class of airspace  ATC may issue mandatory instructions or non binding advisories  known as flight information in some countries   While pilots are required to obey all ATC instructions  the pilot in command of an aircraft always retains final authority for its safe operation  In an emergency  the pilot may deviate from ATC instructions to the extent required to maintain the safety of the aircraft     Weather conditions such as thunderstorms  strong winds  and low visibility can significantly affect air traffic control operations  leading to delays  diversions  and the need for alternate routing       Language edit  Pursuant to requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO   ATC operations are conducted either in the English language  or the local language used by the station on the ground     In practice  the native language for a region is used  however  English must be used upon request      See also  Aeronautical phraseology and Aviation English History edit  In       Croydon Airport near London  England  was the first airport in the world to introduce air traffic control      The  aerodrome control tower  was a wooden hut    feet    metres  high with windows on all four sides   It was commissioned on    February       and provided basic traffic  weather  and location information to pilots        In the United States  air traffic control developed three divisions  The first of several air mail radio stations  AMRS  was created in       after World War I  when the U S  Post Office began using techniques developed by the U S  Army to direct and track the movements of reconnaissance aircraft  Over time  the AMRS morphed into flight service stations  Today s flight service stations do not issue control instructions  but provide pilots with many other flight related informational services  They do relay control instructions from ATC in areas where flight service is the only facility with radio or phone coverage  The first airport traffic control tower  regulating arrivals  departures  and surface movement of aircraft in the US at a specific airport  opened in Cleveland in       Approach  and departure control facilities were created after adoption of radar in the     s to monitor and control the busy airspace around larger airports  The first air route traffic control center  ARTCC   which directs the movement of aircraft between departure and destination  was opened in Newark in       followed in      by Chicago and Cleveland      After the      Grand Canyon mid air collision  killing all     on board  the FAA was given the air traffic responsibility in the United States in       and this was followed by other countries  In       Britain  France  Germany  and the Benelux countries set up Eurocontrol  intending to merge their airspaces  The first and only attempt to pool controllers between countries is the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre  MUAC   founded in      by Eurocontrol  and covering Belgium  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  and north western Germany  In       the European Union  EU  aimed to create a  Single European Sky   hoping to boost efficiency and gain economies of scale      In the USSR  the first air traffic control service was organized in      on the Moscow   Irkutsk air route  in       control areas were defined along all existing air routes       Airport traffic control tower edit  Control tower at S o Paulo Guarulhos International Airport Control tower at Birmingham Airport  England Small control tower at R ysk l  Airfield in Loppi  Finland The primary method of controlling the immediate airport environment is visual observation from the airport control tower  The tower is typically a tall  windowed structure  located within the airport grounds  The air traffic controllers  usually abbreviated  controller   are responsible for separation and efficient movement of aircraft and vehicles operating on the taxiways and runways of the airport itself  and aircraft in the air near the airport  generally   to    nautical miles    to    kilometres    to    miles   depending on the airport procedures  A controller must carry out the job using the precise and effective application of rules and procedures  however  they need flexible adjustments according to differing circumstances  often under time pressure      In a study which compared stress in the general population and among staff working in this kind of system  there was markedly showed more stress level for controllers  This variation can be explained  at least in part  by the characteristics of the job      Remote and virtual tower  RVT  is a system based on air traffic controllers being located somewhere other than at the local airport tower  and still able to provide air traffic control services               Ground control edit  Inside Pope Field air traffic control tower Ground control  sometimes known as ground movement control  GMC  is responsible for the airport movement areas      Some busier airports have surface movement radar  SMR        Air control or local control edit  Air control  known to pilots as tower or tower control  is responsible for the active runway surfaces       Flight data and clearance delivery edit  Clearance delivery is the position that issues route clearances to aircraft  typically before they commence taxiing  These clearances contain details of the route that the aircraft is expected to fly after departure       Analogous use edit  In the field of supply chain management  the concept of a  supply chain control tower  reflects the  end to end visibility  provided by an air traffic control tower      Ashutoch Gupta  writing for Gartner  observes that a supply chain control tower can be established  by combining people  process  data  organization and technology to improve visibility  control and decision making        Approach and terminal control edit   TRACON  redirects here  For the video game series  see TRACON  series   See also  Terminal control area Potomac Consolidated TRACON in Warrenton  Virginia  United States In the U S   TRACONs are additionally designated by a three digit alphanumeric code   For example  the Chicago TRACON is designated C         Area control centre   en route centre edit  Main article  Area control center The training department at the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center  Leesburg  Virginia  United States An area control center  as opposed to a terminal control center  is a specific type of air traffic control center that primarily controls IFR traffic  or aircraft at high altitude flying by instruments  instead of aircraft that are landing or taking off       Each area control center is assigned a flight information region   and certain area control centers near the coast are also tasked with monitoring aircraft flying over the ocean       Area control centers perform similar duties to other types of air traffic control  such as rerouting aircraft to deal with adverse conditions and directing the course of aircraft to ensure seperation   Radar coverage edit  Unmanned radar on a remote mountain In the past  data on the position if aircraft were mainly determined by the following types of radar   En route radar with a coverage up to     NM      km  Airport surveillance radar  with a coverage up to of    NM     km  of the airport below an elevation of        feet Surface movement radar with a coverage of the airport surface  within   NM      km  Secondary surveillance radar with a coverage within line of sight range E route radar with primary and secondary radar antennas Airport surveillance radar with primary and secondary radar antennas Stand alone secondary surveillance radar In addition to such types of radar  some air navigation service providers  e g   Airservices Australia  the U S  Federal Aviation Administration  Nav Canada  etc   have implemented automatic dependent surveillance   broadcast  ADS B  as part of their surveillance capability   This newer technology reverses the radar concept   Instead of radar  finding  a target by interrogating the transponder  the ADS B equipped aircraft  broadcasts  a position report as determined by the navigation equipment on board the aircraft   ADS C is another mode of automatic dependent surveillance  however ADS C operates in the  contract  mode  where the aircraft reports a position  automatically or initiated by the pilot  based on a predetermined time interval   It is also possible for controllers to request more frequent reports to more quickly establish aircraft position for specific reasons       However  since the cost for each report is charged by the ADS service providers to the company operating the aircraft  disputed   discuss  more frequent reports are not commonly requested  except in emergency situations   ADS C is significant  because it can be used where it is not possible to locate the infrastructure for a radar system  e g   over water    Computerised radar displays are now being designed to accept ADS C inputs as part of their display      verification needed  A radar archive system  RAS  keeps an electronic record of all radar information  preserving it for a few weeks   This information can be useful for search and rescue   When an aircraft has  disappeared  from radar screens  a controller can review the last radar returns from the aircraft to determine its likely position   For an example  see the crash report in the following citation       Problems edit  Traffic edit  Further information  Air traffic flow management Intersecting contrails of aircraft over London  an area of high air traffic Air traffic control errors occur when the separation  either vertical or horizontal  between airborne aircraft falls below the minimum prescribed separation set  for the domestic United States  by the US Federal Aviation Administration   Separation minimums for terminal control areas  TCAs  around airports are lower than en route standards   Errors generally occur during periods following times of intense activity  when controllers tend to relax and overlook the presence of traffic and conditions that lead to loss of minimum separation      text source integrity    Weather edit  Aircraft taking off from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport with the ATC tower in the background According to the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation  CANSO   weather significantly impacts global aviation  with more than     of air traffic delays being attributed to adverse weather conditions  These disruptions cause widespread delays  rerouting by ATC  and cancellations across continents  In       Europe experienced a     increase in weather related en route delays compared to       As increasingly adverse weather intensifies the frequency and severity of these events  CANSO urged collaboration and real time solutions among global aviation stakeholders to mitigate the effects of weather on flight operations      Infrastructure edit  Global ATC infrastructure is a complex network that varies significantly by region  with many countries facing challenges related to outdated technology  staffing shortages  and increasing traffic demand  While some regions  like parts of Europe and the U S   have implemented modernization programs such as SESAR and NextGen      many others  especially in developing nations  still rely on legacy radar systems and voice based communication  which limit efficiency and safety  These disparities contribute to delays and reduce the overall resilience of global air traffic management  According to the ICAO  coordinating ATC systems and accelerating digitalization is essential for meeting future aviation demands       Similarly  a      report from the International Air Transport Association  IATA  emphasizes the urgency of investing in scalable  data driven infrastructure to handle post pandemic growth and ensure sustainability across the network       Congestion edit  Constrained control capacity and growing traffic lead to flight cancellation and delays           In America  delays caused by ATC grew by     between      and            ATC staffing issues were a major factor in congestion      By then the market for air traffic services was worth    bn   More efficient ATC could save       of aviation fuel by avoiding holding patterns and indirect airways      The military takes     of Chinese airspace  congesting the thin corridors open to airliners   The United Kingdom closes its military airspace only during military exercises       Call signs edit  A prerequisite to safe air traffic separation is the assignment and use of distinctive call signs   These are permanently allocated by ICAO on request  usually to scheduled flights  and some air forces and other military services for military flights   There are written call signs with a two or three letter combination followed by the flight number such as AAL    or VLG       As such  they appear on flight plans and ATC radar labels   There are also the audio or radio telephony call signs used on the radio contact between pilots and air traffic control   These are not always identical to their written counterparts   An example of an audio call sign would be  Speedbird       instead of the written  BAW       This is used to reduce the chance of confusion between ATC and the aircraft   By default  the call sign for any other flight is the registration number  or tail number in US parlance  of the aircraft  such as  N         C GABC   or  EC IZD    The short radio telephony call signs for these tail numbers is the last three letters using the NATO phonetic alphabet  e g  ABC  spoken alpha bravo charlie for C GABC   or the last three numbers  e g  three four five for N         In the United States  the prefix may be an aircraft type  model  or manufacturer in place of the first registration character  for example   N       could become  Cessna            Technology edit  The Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  has spent over US   billion on software  but a fully automated system is still yet to be achieved   In       the United Kingdom commissioned a new area control centre into service at the London Area Control Centre  LACC  at Swanwick in Hampshire  relieving a busy suburban centre at West Drayton in Middlesex  north of London Heathrow Airport   Software from Lockheed Martin predominates at the London Area Control Centre   However  the centre was initially troubled by software and communications problems causing delays and occasional shutdowns      Some tools are available in different domains to help the controller further   Flight data processing systems  this is the system  usually one per centre  that processes all the information related to the flight  the flight plan   typically in the time horizon from gate to gate  airport departure   arrival gates    It uses such processed information to invoke other flight plan related tools  such as e g  Medium Term Conflict Detection  MTCD       Short term conflict alert  STCA  that checks possible conflicting trajectories in a time horizon of about two or three minutes  or even less in approach context     seconds in the French Roissy   Orly approach centres       Center TRACON automation system  CTAS   a suite of human centred decision support tools developed by NASA Ames Research Center   Several of the CTAS tools have been field tested and transitioned to the FAA for operational evaluation and use   Some of the CTAS tools are  traffic management advisor  TMA   passive final approach spacing tool  pFAST   collaborative arrival planning  CAP   direct to  D    en route descent advisor  EDA   and multi center TMA   The software is

alterations to traffic control procedures are being examined   Free flight is a developing air traffic control method that uses no centralised control  e g  air traffic controllers    Instead  parts of airspace are reserved dynamically and automatically in a distributed way using computer communication to ensure the required separation between aircraft      In Europe  the Single European Sky ATM Research  SESAR      programme plans to develop new methods  technologies  procedures  and systems to accommodate future       and beyond  air traffic needs   In October       European controller unions dismissed setting targets to improve ATC as  a waste of time and effort   as new technology could cut costs for users but threaten their jobs   In April       the EU called for a  Digital European Sky   focusing on cutting costs by including a common digitisation standard  and allowing controllers to move to where they are needed instead of merging national ATCs  as it would not solve all problems   Single air traffic control services in continent sized America and China does not alleviate congestion   Eurocontrol tries to reduce delays by diverting flights to less busy routes  flight paths across Europe were redesigned to accommodate the new airport in Istanbul  which opened in April  but the extra capacity will be absorbed by rising demand for air travel      Well paid jobs in western Europe could move east with cheaper labour   The average Spanish controller earn over          a year  over seven times the country average salary  more than pilots  and at least ten controllers were paid over               m  a year in        French controllers spent a cumulative nine months on strike between      and            Privatisation edit  Many countries have also privatised or corporatised their air navigation service providers       There are several models that can be used for ATC service providers   The first is to have the ATC services be part of a government agency as is currently the case in the United States   The problem with this model is that funding can be inconsistent  and can disrupt the development and operation of services   Sometimes funding can disappear when lawmakers cannot approve budgets in time   Both proponents and opponents of privatisation recognise that stable funding is one of the major factors for successful upgrades of ATC infrastructure   Some of the funding issues include sequestration and politicisation of projects       Proponents argue that moving ATC services to a private corporation could stabilise funding over the long term which will result in more predictable planning and rollout of new technology as well as training of personnel  As of November       The United States had     contractor towers that are staffed by private companies but administered by FAA through its FAA Contract Tower Program  which was established in       These contract control towers cover     of all the Federal air traffic control towers in the U S      Another model is to have ATC services provided by a government corporation   This model is used in Germany  where funding is obtained through user fees   Yet another model is to have a for profit corporation operate ATC services   This is the model used in the United Kingdom  but there have been several issues with the system there  including a large scale failure in December      which caused delays and cancellations and has been attributed to cost cutting measures put in place by this corporation   In fact  earlier that year  the corporation owned by the German government won the bid to provide ATC services for Gatwick Airport in the United Kingdom   The last model  which is often the suggested model for the United States to transition to is to have a non profit organisation that would handle ATC services as is used in Canada      The Canadian system is the one most often used as a model by proponents of privatisation   Air traffic control privatisation has been successful in Canada with the creation of Nav Canada  a private non profit organisation which has reduced costs  and has allowed new technologies to be deployed faster due to the elimination of much of the bureaucratic red tape   This has resulted in shorter flights and less fuel usage   It has also resulted in flights being safer due to new technology   Nav Canada is funded from fees that are collected from the airlines based on the weight of the aircraft and the distance flown      Air traffic control is operated by national governments with few exceptions  in the European Union  only Italy has private shareholders       Privatisation does not guarantee lower prices  the profit margin of MUAC was     in       as there is no competition  but governments could offer fixed terms concessions       ATC regulations in the United States edit  The United States airspace is divided into    zones  centres   and each zone is divided into sectors  Also within each zone are portions of airspace  about    miles     kilometres  in diameter  called TRACON  Terminal Radar Approach Control  airspaces  Within each TRACON airspace are a number of airports  each of which has its own airspace with a   miles      kilometres  radius  FAA control tower operators  CTO    air traffic controllers use FAA Order         as the authority for all procedures regarding air

pilot Lt  F W   Mike  Hunter wearing a flight suit in October      An aircraft pilot  or aviator  is an individual who controls an aircraft s flight by operating its directional controls  Other aircrew members  such as navigators and flight engineers  are also considered aviators because they assist in operating the aircraft s navigation and engine systems  Aircrew members like drone operators  flight attendants  mechanics  and ground crew are not classified as aviators  To recognize pilots  qualifications and responsibilities  most militaries and many airlines around the world award aviator badges to their pilots    Definition edit  The first recorded use of the term aviator  aviateur in French  was in       as a variation of aviation  from the Latin avis  meaning bird   coined in      by G  J  G  de La Landelle  fr  in Aviation Ou Navigation A rienne   Aviation or Air Navigation    The term aviatrix  aviatrice in French   now archaic  was formerly used for a female pilot  The term aviator  aviateur in French   now archaic  was formerly used for a male pilot  People who operate aircraft obtain a pilot licence  Aviation regulations referred to pilots  These terms were used more in the early days of aviation  when airplanes were extremely rare  and connoted bravery and adventure  For example  a      reference work described the Wright brothers  first airplane   The weight  including the body of the aviator  is a little more than     pounds       History edit  This section needs expansion  You can help by adding to it    March       To ensure the safety of people in the air and on the ground  early aviation soon required that aircraft be under the operational control of a properly trained  certified pilot at all times  who is responsible for the safe and legal completion of the flight  The  A ro Club de France delivered the first certificate to Louis Bl riot in      followed by Glenn Curtiss  L on Delagrange  and Robert Esnault Pelterie  The British Royal Aero Club followed in      and the Aero Club of America in       Glenn Curtiss receiving the first    Civilian edit  Pilots landing a Boeing     Civilian pilots fly aircraft of all types privately for pleasure  charity  or in pursuance of a business  or commercially for non scheduled  charter  and scheduled passenger and cargo air carriers  airlines   corporate aviation  agriculture  crop dusting  etc    forest fire control  law enforcement  etc  When flying for an airline  pilots are usually referred to as airline pilots  with the pilot in command often referred to as the captain   Airline edit  There were         airline pilots in the world in      and aircraft simulator manufacturer CAE Inc  forecasts a need for         new ones for a population of         by               for growth and         to offset retirement and attrition         in Asia Pacific  average pilot age in            years          in Americas     years          in Europe       years  and        in Middle East   Africa       years      Boeing expects         new pilots in    years from               for commercial aviation         for business aviation and        for helicopters      in Asia Pacific                in North America                in Europe               in the Middle East              in Latin America              in Africa          and    in Russia  Central Asia              By November       due a shortage of qualified pilots  some pilots were leaving corporate aviation to return to airlines  In one example a Global      pilot  making          a year for    to    flight hours a month  returned to American Airlines with full seniority  A Gulfstream G    or Global      pilot might earn between          and           and recruiting one may require up to           At the other end of the spectrum  constrained by the available pilots  some small carriers hire new pilots who need     hours to jump to airlines in a year  They may also recruit non career pilots who have other jobs or airline retirees who want to continue to fly      Automation edit  The number of airline pilots could decrease as automation replaces copilots and eventually pilots as well  In January      Rhett Ross  CEO of Continental Motors said  my concern is that in the next two decades if not sooner automated and autonomous flight will have developed sufficiently to put downward pressure on both wages and the number and kind of flying jobs available  So if a kid asks the question now and he or she is        years from now will be      and our would be careerist will be    not even mid career  Who among us thinks aviation and especially for hire flying will look like it does now   Christian Dries  owner of Diamond Aircraft Austria said  Behind the curtain  aircraft manufacturers are working on a single pilot cockpit where the airplane can be controlled from the ground and only in case of malfunction does the pilot of the plane interfere  Basically the flight will be autonomous and I expect this to happen in the next five to six years for freighters   needs update     In August      financial company UBS predicted pilotless airliners are technically

capacity utilization  Regulations have to adapt with air cargo likely at the forefront  but pilotless flights could be limited by consumer behaviour      of       people surveyed are defiant while     are supportive  with acceptation progressively forecast     AVweb reporter Geoff Rapoport stated   pilotless aircraft are an appealing prospect for airlines bracing for the need to hire several hundred thousand new pilots in the next decade  Wages and training costs have been rapidly rising at regional U S  airlines over the last several years as the major airlines have hired pilots from the regionals at unprecedented rates to cover increased air travel demand from economic expansion and a wave of retirements      Going to pilotless airliners could be done in one bold step or in gradual improvements like by reducing the cockpit crew for long haul missions or allowing single pilot cargo aircraft  The industry has not decided how to proceed yet  Present automated systems are not autonomous and must be monitored  their replacement could require artificial intelligence with machine learning while present certified software is deterministic     As the Airbus A    would only need minor modifications  Air Caraibes and French Bee parent Groupe Dubreuil see two pilot crews in long haul operations  without a third pilot for rotation  happening around               Single pilot freighters could start with regional flights      The Air Line Pilots Association believe removing pilots would threaten aviation safety and opposes the April      FAA Reauthorization Act s Section

AIs can be expected in the next decade  as the Onera expects  leads  for a certifiable AI system  along EASA standards evolution       Africa and Asia edit  In some countries  such as Pakistan  Thailand and several African nations  there is a strong relationship between the military and the principal national airlines  and many airline pilots come from the military  however  that is no longer the case in the United States and Western Europe  citation needed  While the flight decks of U S  and European airliners do have ex military pilots  many pilots are civilians  Military training and flying  while rigorous  is fundamentally different in many ways from civilian piloting   Canada edit  Operating an aircraft in Canada is regulated by the Aeronautics Act of      and the Canadian Aviation Regulations provide rules for Pilot licensing in Canada  Retirement age is provided by each airline  with some set to age     but changes to the Canadian Human Rights Act have restricted the retirement age set by the airlines       United States edit  In the United States in       there were         active pilot certificates      This was down from a high of over         active pilots in           Of the active pilot certificate holders  there were         Private          Commercial          Airline Transport  and         Student      In       the Air Commerce Act established pilot

S  Air Force F    pilot in flight Military pilots fly with the armed forces  primarily the air forces  of a government or nation state  Their tasks involve combat and non combat operations  including direct hostile engagements and support operations  Military pilots undergo specialized training  often with weapons  Examples of military pilots include fighter pilots  bomber pilots  transport pilots  test pilots  and astronauts   Captain Marcel Courmes  French officer and pilot of the  nd Bombardment Group GB    August       Military pilots are trained with a different syllabus than civilian pilots  which is delivered by military instructors  This is due to the different aircraft  flight goals  flight situations and chains of responsibility  Many military pilots do transfer to civilian pilot qualification after they leave the military  and typically their military experience provides the basis for a civilian pilot s license  It was in France that the world s first bombing group was created  on November           The Voisin III were the only aircraft available for this mission  These could only carry very light loads  between        kg of bombs   the bombs were rudimentary and the aiming systems remained to be developed  Initially  the bombs were simply thrown overboard by the crew  with necessarily very limited accuracy  Nevertheless  the beginnings of tactical and strategic bombing took place in the first days of the war  Thus  the Royal Naval Air Service  RNAS  carried out bombing missions of the hangars of the airports of D sseldorf  Cologne and Friedrichhafen during the autumn of       The formation of the Brieftauben Abteilung Ostende   Ostend Carrier Pigeon Detachment   name of code of the first German bombing units  carried out bombing missions over the English Channel in December        Unmanned aerial vehicles edit  Further information  Unmanned aerial vehicle   Degree of autonomy A United States Air Force RPA pilot  Unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs  also known as  drones   operate without a pilot on board and are classed into two categories  autonomous aircraft that operate without active human control during flight and remotely piloted UAVs which are operated remotely by one or more persons  The person controlling a remotely piloted UAV may be referred to as its pilot or operator  Depending on the sophistication and use of the UAV  pilots operators of UAVs may require certification or training  but are generally not subject to the licensing certification requirements of pilots of manned aircraft  Most jurisdictions have restrictions on the use of UAVs which have greatly limited their use in controlled airspace  UAVs have mostly been limited to military and hobbyist use  In the United States  use of UAVs is very limited in controlled airspace  generally  above     ft    m and away from airports   and the FAA prohibits nearly all commercial use  Once regulations are made to allow expanded use of UAVs in controlled airspace  there is expected to be a large surge of UAVs in use and  consequently  high demand for pilots operators of these aircraft       Space edit  Picture of astronaut going through pilot training exercise  The general concept of an airplane pilot can be applied to human spaceflight  as well  The pilot is the astronaut who directly controls the operation of a spacecraft  This term derives directly from the usage of the word  pilot  in aviation  where it is synonymous with  aviator    Pilot certifications edit  Military aviation training in a Royal Air Force Nimrod aircraft Further information  Pilot licensing and certification Pilots are required to go through many hours of flight training and theoretical study  that differ depending on the country  The first step is acquiring the Private Pilot License  PPL   or Private Pilot Certificate   In the United States of America  this includes a minimum of    to    hours of flight training  the majority of which with a Certified Flight Instructor  In the United States  an LSA  Light Sport Aircraft  license can be obtained in at least    hours of flight time  Generally  the next step in a pilot s progression is Instrument Rating  IR   or Multi Engine Rating  MEP  addons  Pilots may also choose to pursue a Commercial Pilot License  CPL  after completing their PPL  This is required if the pilot desires to pursue a professional career as a pilot  To captain an airliner  one must obtain an Airline Transport Pilot License  ATPL   In the United States after   August       an ATPL is required even when acting as a first officer      Some countries carriers require use a multi crew cooperation  MCC  certificate   Life expectancy edit  There is a popular belief that airline pilots die earlier than the general population  This belief was not supported by studies of American Airlines and British Airways pilots              A hoax claiming to show an inverse relationship between retirement age and life expectancy was refuted by Boeing          However  a study of several airline pilot associations  data found evidence of higher mortality      A      study of military pilots found increased longevity  which was attributed to  generally good socioeconomic background  the positive genetic influence of long lived parents  the above average intelligence  and the health and fitness

landing accident in      Delta Connection Flight      main body sitting upside down on Toronto Pearson International Airport runway    on February          An aviation accident is an event during aircraft operation that results in serious injury  death  or significant destruction  An aviation incident is any operating event that compromises safety but does not escalate into an aviation accident  Preventing both accidents and incidents is the primary goal of aviation safety  Adverse weather conditions  including turbulence  thunderstorms  icing  and low visibility  have historically been major contributing factors in aviation accidents and incidents worldwide        Definitions edit  According to Annex    of the Convention on International Civil Aviation  an aviation accident is an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft  which takes place from the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until all such persons have disembarked  and in which  a  a person is fatally or seriously injured   b  the aircraft sustains significant damage or structural failure  or  c  the aircraft goes missing or becomes completely inaccessible      Annex    defines an aviation incident as an occurrence  other than an accident  associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operation     A hull loss occurs if an aircraft is damaged beyond repair  is lost  or becomes completely inaccessible      History edit  One of the earliest recorded aviation accidents occurred on May           when a hot air balloon crashed in Tullamore  County Offaly  Ireland  The resulting fire seriously damaged the town  destroying over     homes     The first accident involving a powered aircraft occurred on September           when a Wright Model A crashed at Fort Myer  Virginia  USA  The pilot and co inventor  Orville Wright  was injured  and the passenger  Signal Corps Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge  was killed     The first aircraft accident in which     or more people died occurred on March          when     died in the crash of Turkish Airlines Flight      As of July      update   there have been a total of    aviation incidents in which     or more people have died   Accident Investigation Team from the Civil Aeronautics Board with Director  Bobbie R  Allen   about      CAB Supervisor Bobbie R  Allen and FAA Administrator Najeeb Halaby discuss accident details   about      The period from      to      saw tremendous growth in aviation  Improvements in aviation safety and accident investigation procedures were rapidly advancing  In       the Civil Aeronautics Board  under the leadership of then Deputy Director Bobbie R  Allen  established the National Aircraft Accident Investigation School in Oklahoma City  The ICAO s third accident investigation division meeting  held in Montreal  Canada  in January       laid the foundation for accident investigations throughout the world   The proposals were presented by the Director of the Civil Aeronautics Board Bureau of Safety  Bobbie R  Allen  who headed the U S  delegation  The U S  formally adopted the proposals at the White House on December             The top    countries with the highest number of fatal civil airliner accidents from      to      are the United States  Russia  Canada  Brazil  Colombia  United Kingdom  France  Indonesia  Mexico  and India     The United Kingdom is noted to have the highest number of air crashes in Europe  with a total of     air crashes within the time period  and Indonesia is the highest in Asia at      followed by India at        The most fatalities on board a single aircraft are the     fatalities of the      Japan Air Lines Flight     accident  The largest loss of life in a single aviation accident are the     fatalities of the       Tenerife airport disaster  in which two Boeing    s collided  The largest loss of life overall in a collective incident are the       fatalities in the coordinated terrorist destruction of airplanes and occupied buildings in the      September    attacks  the first plane to be hijacked and crashed as part of the attack  American Airlines Flight     was alone responsible for an estimated       fatalities in total  making it the single deadliest aviation disaster in history   September    attacks edit  Main article  September    attacks United Airlines Flight     crashes into the South Tower of the World Trade Center  The deadliest aviation related disaster regarding fatalities both on board the aircraft and casualties on the ground  was the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York City on September           On that morning  four commercial jet airliners on transcontinental flights from East Coast airports to California were hijacked after takeoff  The four hijacked aircraft were subsequently crashed in a series of four coordinated suicide attacks against major American landmarks by    Islamist terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda  American Airlines Flight    and United Airlines Flight      both regularly scheduled domestic transcontinental flights from Boston to Los Angeles  were hijacked by five men each  with the assigned pilot hijacker taking control of the flight  before being intentionally crashed into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center  respectively  destroying both buildings in less than two hours  The World Trade Center crashes killed        As both planes were carrying a combined total of     occupants  the vast majority of fatalities were the occupants of the two towers and the emergency personnel responding to the disaster   In addition      were killed by the impact of American Airlines Flight     which crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington County  Virginia  causing severe damage and partial destruction to the building s west side  The crash of United Airlines Flight    into a field in Somerset County  Pennsylvania  which occurred as passengers attempted to retake control of the aircraft from the hijackers  killed all    passengers and crew aboard the aircraft  This brought the total number of casualties of the September    attacks to        including the    terrorist hijackers    As deliberate terrorist acts  the      crashes were not classified as accidents  but as mass killing  The events were treated by the member nations of NATO as an act of war and terrorism  The war on terror was subsequently launched by NATO in response to the attacks  eventually leading to the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden  who orchestrated the September    attacks   Tenerife disaster edit  Computer graphics reconstruction of the moment immediately before the disaster  KLM Flight       right  is about to collide with Pan Am Flight       left   Part of the fog has been removed to give a clearer picture of the two planes  Main article  Tenerife airport disaster The Tenerife airport disaster on March           remains the accident with the highest number of airliner passenger fatalities      people died when a KLM Boeing     attempted to take off and collided with a taxiing Pan Am     at Los Rodeos Airport on the Canary Island of Tenerife  Spain  All     passengers and    crew of the KLM aircraft died and     of the     passengers and crew of the Pan Am aircraft died  Pilot error was the primary cause  the KLM captain mistakenly believed he had received air traffic control clearance and initiated takeoff        Other contributing factors were a terrorist incident at Gran Canaria Airport that had caused many flights to be diverted to Los Rodeos  a small airport not well equipped to handle aircraft of such size  dense fog  poor radio phraseology  and controller distraction  The KLM flight crew could not see the Pan Am aircraft on the runway until immediately before the collision      The accident had a lasting influence on the industry  particularly in the area of communication  An increased emphasis was placed on

and     of the     passengers aboard died      Japanese military personnel inaccurately assumed  during a helicopter flyover of the impact site  that there were no survivors  Rescue operations were delayed until the following morning  Medical providers involved in rescue and analysis operations determined that several passengers likely survived the impact and probably would have survived the incident had rescue operations not been delayed  Four passengers survived the incident in its entirety  meaning that they were alive when discharged from the hospital       Other crashes with death

collided mid air over the town of Charkhi Dadri  near Delhi  India  The collision was mainly the result of the Kazakh pilot flying lower than the assigned clearance altitude  All     occupants on board the two aircraft died      It remains the world s deadliest mid air collision without survivors      The Ramesh Chandra Lahoti Commission  empowered to study the causes  recommended the creation of the  semi circular rule   to prevent aircraft from flying in opposite directions at the same altitude      The Civil Aviation Authorities in India made it mandatory for all aircraft flying in and out of India to be equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System  TCAS   setting a worldwide precedent for mandatory use of TCAS         March          Turkish Airlines Flight      McDonnell Douglas DC     Turkish Airlines Flight     crashed in a forest northeast of Paris  France  The London bound aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Orly airport  all     people aboard died      It was later determined that the cargo door detached  which caused an explosive decompression  this caused the floor just above to collapse  The collapsed floor severed the control cables  which left the pilots without control of the elevators  the rudder and No    engine  The aircraft entered a steep dive and crashed  It was the deadliest plane crash of all time until the Tenerife disaster in       It remains the deadliest single aircraft crash with no survivors  This accident was also the deadliest single aircraft crash that did not involve a Boeing             June           Air India Flight      Boeing          Air India Flight     en route from Toronto and Montreal to London and Delhi  crashed off the southwest coast of Ireland when a bomb exploded in the cargo hold  All     passengers and    crew members died      One passenger had checked in as  M  Singh   Singh did not board the flight but his suitcase  containing the bomb  was loaded onto the aircraft   M  Singh  was never identified or captured  It was later determined Sikh extremists were behind the bombing as a retaliation for the Indian government s attack on the Golden Temple in the city of Amritsar  spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism  This was  at the time  the deadliest terrorist attack involving an airplane             August           Saudia Flight      Lockheed L       Saudia Flight     became the world s deadliest aviation accident that did not involve a crash  The crew performed an emergency landing at Riyadh after a fire broke out in an aft baggage compartment  The fire burned through the ceiling of the compartment and into the passenger cabin  The crew landed the aircraft safely  but the captain did not stop immediately and order an evacuation  He taxied off the runway instead  by which time everyone in the cabin had become unconscious due to fumes and were unable to open any doors or evacuate  All     passengers and crew aboard died of suffocation before rescue ground crews could open any door  after which the aircraft burst into flames and was consumed by fire             July           Malaysia Airlines Flight     Boeing        ER  Malaysia Airlines Flight    flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur  was shot down in an area of Eastern Ukraine near the Ukraine Russian border during the war in Donbas  There were     people on board      passengers and    crew members  all of whom died  The crew were all Malaysians  while the passengers were of various nationalities  most from the Netherlands  Several Ukrainian Air Force  UAF  aircraft had been shot down over the rebel controlled territory before the MH   incident  Immediately after the crash  a post appeared on the VKontakte social media profile attributed to Igor Girkin  leader of the Donbas separatist militia  claiming responsibility for shooting down a Ukrainian An    military transport near Torez      The post was removed later the same day  and the separatists then denied shooting down any aircraft                     July          Iran Air Flight      Airbus A         Iran Air Flight      an Iranian civilian airliner  was shot down by two surface to air missiles from the U S  Navy guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes over the Strait of Hormuz  All     passengers and crew aboard the aircraft died  The downing was caused by a series of mistakes that led the USS Vincennes crew to believe that the airliner was an Iranian Air Force F            February           Iranian military aircraft  Ilyushin Il     An Iranian military Ilyushin Il    crashed in mountainous terrain

    China Airlines Flight      Boeing        B  China Airlines Flight     bound for Hong Kong International Airport in Hong Kong  disintegrated in mid air and crashed into the Taiwan Strait    minutes after takeoff from Chiang Kai shek International Airport  now Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport  in Taiwan  It was determined that the crash  which killed all     passengers and    crew members aboard the plane  was caused by improper repairs to the aircraft    years earlier when the aircraft encountered a tailstrike         October           Metrojet Flight       Airbus A         Metrojet Flight      crashed in the Sinai Peninsula after departing Sharm el Sheikh International Airport  Egypt  en route to Pulkovo Airport  Saint Petersburg  Russia  All     occupants on board were killed  A branch of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for bringing down the jet  and a Russian investigation concluded that a bomb was detonated inside the plane at a high altitude         May           Lauda Air Flight      Boeing      Z ER  Lauda Air Flight     broke up in midair over a remote area of Thailand due to an uncommanded deployment of a thrust reverser on

was en route to Vienna International Airport  Vienna  Austria  when the accident occurred         October           EgyptAir Flight      Boeing        ER  EgyptAir Flight     flying from Los Angeles International Airport  United States  to Cairo International Airport  Egypt  with a stop at John F  Kennedy International Airport  New York City  crashed into the Atlantic Ocean south of Nantucket Island  Massachusetts  killing all     occupants onboard  The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the crash was deliberate action by the relief first officer in response to his removal from international service within Egyptair  a finding disputed by Egyptian authorities who maintain another cause of the accident         January          Air India Flight      Boeing        B  Air India Flight     crashed into the Arabian Sea just off the coast of Bombay  India  killing all     occupants on board  An investigation concluded that the captain became disoriented after the failure of one of the flight instruments in the cockpit  leading to  irrational control inputs  that caused the plane to crash         February           China Airlines Flight      Airbus A   B     R  China Airlines Flight     en route from Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali  Indonesia  to Chiang Kai shek International Airport  now Taoyuan International Airport   Taiwan  crashed into a road and residential neighborhood in Taoyuan  Taiwan  killing     passengers     crew  and six people on the ground  An investigation determined that when the control tower ordered the pilot to abort his landing and  go around  for a second attempt  the pilot  who had unintentionally released the plane s autopilot  did nothing to take control of the plane for    seconds as he apparently thought the autopilot would initiate the go around  As the aircraft approached the airport  the pilot executed a sudden steep ascent that produced a stall and crash  China Airlines was also criticized for  insufficient training          July           Aeroflot Flight       Tupolev Tu    B    Aeroflot Flight      on a domestic Karshi Ufa Leningrad route  crashed near Uchkuduk  Uzbek SSR  Soviet Union  on the first leg of its route  All     occupants onboard were killed  An investigation concluded that the plane went down due to pilot error  The air crew used an inappropriately low airspeed  causing vibrations that they incorrectly interpreted as engine surges  As a result  they further reduced engine power  causing the aircraft to stall and crash   Safety edit  Main article  Aviation safety Controlled Impact Demonstration by NASA and the FAA  December      In over one hundred years of implementation  aviation safety has improved considerably  In modern times  two major manufacturers still produce heavy passenger aircraft for the civilian market  Boeing in the United States  and the European company Airbus  Both of these manufacturers place a huge emphasis on the use of aviation safety equipment  now a billion dollar industry in its own right  safety is a key selling point for these companies  as they recognize that a poor safety record in the aviation industry is a threat to corporate survival  Some major safety devices now required in commercial aircraft are   Evacuation slides  to aid rapid passenger exit from an aircraft in an emergency situation     Advanced avionics  incorporating computerized auto recovery and alert systems     Turbine engines with improved durability and failure containment mechanisms     Landing gear that can be lowered even after loss of power and hydraulics     Measured on a passenger distance calculation  air travel is the safest form of transportation available  Figures mentioned are the ones shared by the air industry when quoting air safety statistics  A typical statement  e g   by the BBC   UK airline operations are among the safest anywhere  When compared against all other modes of transport on a fatality per mile basis  air transport is the safest   six times safer than travelling by car and twice as safe as rail        Brazilian Air Force personnel recover the flight data recorder of Gol Transportes A reos Flight       which crashed on September           When measured by fatalities per person transported  however  buses are the safest form of transportation  The number of air travel fatalities per person are surpassed only by bicycles and motorcycles  This statistic is used by the insurance industry when calculating insurance rates for air travel      For every billion kilometers traveled  trains have a fatality rate that is    times higher than that of air travel  and the fatality rate for automobiles is    times greater than for air travel  By contrast  for every billion journeys taken  buses are the safest form of transportation  using this measure  air travel is three times more dangerous than car transportation  and almost    times more dangerous than travelling by bus      A      study by Popular Mechanics magazine found that passengers sitting at the back of an aeroplane are     more likely to survive a crash than those sitting at the front  The article quotes Boeing  the FAA  and a website on aircraft safety  all of which claim that there is no  safest  seat  The study examined    crashes  not taking into account the developments in safety after those accidents      However  a flight data recorder is usually mounted in the aircraft s empennage  tail section  where it is more likely to survive a severe crash  Between      and       the survival rate for people in U S  plane crashes was greater than    percent       Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System edit  In an effort to prevent incidents such as the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH     a new standard has been issued requiring all commercial aircraft to report their position every    minutes to air traffic controllers regardless of the country of origin  Introduced in      by the ICAO  the regulation has no initial requirement for any new aircraft equipment to be fitted  The standard is part of a long term plan  called the Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System  GADSS   which will require new aircraft to be equipped with data broadcast systems that are in constant contact with air traffic controllers      The GADSS is similar to the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System  GMDSS  used for maritime safety       Aviation Safety Reporting System edit  The Aviation Safety Reporting System  ASRS  collects voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident situation reports from pilots  controllers and others  The ASRS uses reports to identify system deficiencies  issue alert messages  and produce two publications  CALLBACK  and ASRS Directline  The collected information is made available to the public  and is used by the FAA  NASA and other organizations working in research and flight safety       Statistics edit  Bureau of Aircraft

Switzerland  compiles statistics on aviation accidents of aircraft capable of carrying more than six passengers  excluding helicopters  balloons  and combat aircraft  ACRO only considers crashes in which the aircraft has suffered such damage that it is removed from service  which will further reduce the statistics for incidents and fatalities compared to some other data  The total fatalities due to aviation accidents since      are         The total number of incidents are             According to ACRO  recent years have been considerably safer for aviation  with fewer than     incidents

morphable wings  wing less lifting bodies  as well as lighter than air aircraft such as hot air balloons and airships  Aviation began in the   th century with the development of the hot air balloon  an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy  Cl ment Ader built the  Ader  ole  in France and made an uncontrolled  powered hop in       This was the first powered aircraft  although it did not achieve controlled flight  Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of Otto Lilienthal in       A major leap followed with the construction of the Wright Flyer  the first powered airplane by the Wright brothers in the early     s   Since that time  aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the jet engine which enabled aviation to become a major form of transport throughout the world  In       there were     billion passengers worldwide according to the ICAO     As of       estimates suggest that     of the world s population traveled by air  with up to    taking international flights       Etymology edit  The word aviation was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in          He originally derived the term from the verb avier  an unsuccessful neologism for  to fly    itself derived from the Latin word avis   bird   and the suffix  ation      History edit  Main article  History of aviation For a chronological guide  see Timeline of aviation  Early beginnings edit  There are early legends of human flight such as the stories of Icarus in Greek myth  Jamshid and Shah Kay K vus in Persian myth     and the flying automaton of Archytas of Tarentum          BC      Later  somewhat more credible claims according to whom   of short distance human flights appear  such as the winged flights of Abbas ibn Firnas           recorded in the   th century   Eilmer of Malmesbury    th century  recorded in the   th century  and the hot air Passarola of Bartholomeu Louren o de Gusm o                  Lighter than air edit  LZ     Hindenburg at Lakehurst Naval Air Station        The modern age of aviation began with the first untethered human lighter than air flight on November           of a hot air balloon designed by the Montgolfier brothers     The usefulness of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind  The first steerable dirigible  balloon was flown by Jean Pierre Blanchard in       It was human powered and  Blanchard completed a successful crossing of the English Channel in one in       Rigid airships became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances  The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German Zeppelin company  The most successful Zeppelin was the Graf Zeppelin  It flew over one million miles  including an around the world flight in August       However  the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period  which had a range of only a few hundred miles  was diminishing as airplane design advanced  The  Golden Age  of the airships ended on May          according to whom   That year the Hindenburg caught fire  killing    people  The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas  An internal investigation by the manufacturer found that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship     Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents  Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use  airships have seen only niche application since that time      There had been previous airship accidents that were more fatal  for instance  a British R   on    August           but the Hindenburg was the first to be captured on newsreel       Heavier than air edit   Lilienthal in mid flight  Berlin c        First powered and controlled flight by the Wright brothers  December           The Cessna     is the most produced aircraft in history      NASA s Helios researches solar powered flight   In       Sir George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed wing flying machine with separate systems for lift  propulsion and control          Otto Lilienthal was the first person to make well documented  repeated  successful flights with gliders      therefore making the idea of  heavier than air  a reality  Newspapers and magazines published photographs of Lilienthal gliding  favorably influencing public and scientific opinion about the possibility of flying machines becoming practical  Lilienthal s work led him to develop the concept of the modern wing          His flight attempts in Berlin in      are seen as the beginning of human flight     and the Lilienthal Normalsegelapparat is considered to be the first airplane in series production  making the Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal in Berlin the first air plane production company in the world      Lilienthal is often referred to as either the  father of aviation              or  father of flight       The late   th and early   th centuries saw dirigible developments  such as Henri Giffard s included machine powered propulsion Giffard dirigible in       David Schwarz  rigid frame dirigible in      and  Alberto Santos Dumont s improvements to speed and maneuverability in       There are many competing claims for the earliest powered  heavier than air flight  The first recorded powered flight was carried out by Cl ment Ader on October          in his bat winged  fully self propelled fixed wing aircraft  the Ader  ole  It was reportedly the first manned  powered  heavier than air flight of a significant distance of    meters      ft   but insignificant altitude from level ground              Seven years later  on October           Ader s Avion III was tested without success in front of two officials from the French War ministry  The report on the trials was not publicized until       as they had been a military secret  In November       Ader said that he made a successful flight on October          and achieved an uninterrupted flight of around     meters      feet   Although widely believed at the time  these claims were later discredited          The Wright brothers made the first successful powered  controlled and sustained airplane flight on December           a feat made possible by their invention of three axis control     and in house development of an engine with a sufficient power to weight ratio      A decade later  at the start of World War I  heavier than air powered aircraft had become practical for reconnaissance  artillery spotting and attacks against ground positions  Aircraft began to transport people and cargo as designs grew larger and more reliable  The Wright brothers took aloft the first passenger  Charles Furnas  one of their mechanics  on May                   During the     s and     s great progress was made in the field of aviation  including the first transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown in       Charles Lindbergh s solo transatlantic flight in      and Charles Kingsford Smith s transpacific flight the following year  One of the most successful designs of this period was the Douglas DC    which became the first airliner to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively  starting the modern era of passenger airline service  By the beginning of World War II  many towns and cities had built airports  and there were numerous qualified pilots available  During World War II one of the first jet engines was developed by Hans von Ohain and accomplished the world s first jet powered flight in           The war brought many innovations to aviation  including the first jet aircraft and the first liquid fueled rockets  After World War II  especially in North America  there was a boom in general aviation  both private and commercial  as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war surplus transport and training aircraft became available  Manufacturers such as Cessna  Piper  and Beechcraft expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle class market  By the     s  the development of civil jets grew  beginning with the de Havilland Comet  though the first widely used passenger jet was the Boeing      because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time  At the same time  turboprop propulsion started to appear for smaller commuter planes  making it possible to serve small volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions  Since the     s composite material airframes and quieter  more efficient engines have become available  and Concorde provided supersonic passenger service for more than two decades  However  the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control  The arrival of solid state electronics  the Global Positioning System  satellite communications  and increasingly small and powerful computers and LED displays  have dramatically changed the cockpits of airliners and  increasingly  of smaller aircraft as well  Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain  obstructions  and other nearby aircraft on a map or through synthetic vision  even at night or in low visibility  On June           SpaceShipOne became the first privately funded aircraft to make a spaceflight  opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth s atmosphere  Meanwhile  the need to decarbonize the aviation industry to face the climate crisis has increased research into aircraft powered by alternative fuels  such as ethanol  electricity  hydrogen  and solar energy  with flying prototypes becoming more common   Operations of aircraft edit  A United Airlines Boeing         taxiing on the tarmac of Heathrow Airport in January       The Boeing     is a popular choice for airlines that operate a wide body aircraft  Civil aviation edit  Main article  Civil aviation Further information  Commercial aviation and Private aviation Civil aviation includes all non military flying  both general aviation and scheduled air transport   Air transport edit  Main article  Airline A Delta Air Lines Airbus A        taking off at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in July      There are seven major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft   Airbus  based in Europe Antonov  based in Ukraine Boeing  based in the United States Bombardier  based in Canada Comac  based in China Embraer  based in Brazil United Aircraft Corporation  based in Russia  with its subsidiaries Ilyushin  Tupolev  Yakovlev and Sukhoi Boeing  Airbus  Ilyushin and Tupolev concentrate on wide body and narrow body jet airliners  while Bombardier  Embraer and Sukhoi concentrate on regional airliners  Large networks of specialized parts suppliers from around the world support these manufacturers  who sometimes provide only the initial design and final assembly in their own plants  The Chinese ACAC consortium has also recently when   entered the civil transport market with its Comac ARJ   regional jet          Until the     s  most major airlines were flag carriers  sponsored by their governments and heavily protected from competition  Since then  open skies agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers  coupled with falling prices for airlines  The combination of high fuel prices  low fares  high salaries  as well as crises such as the September    attacks and the SARS pandemic have driven many older airlines to government bailouts  bankruptcy or mergers  At the same time  low cost carriers such as Ryanair  Southwest and WestJet have flourished   General aviation edit  Main article  General aviation      Piper Cub  General aviation includes all non scheduled civil flying  both private and commercial  General aviation may include business flights  air charter  private aviation  flight training  ballooning  paragliding  parachuting  gliding  hang gliding  aerial photography  foot launched powered hang gliders  air ambulance  crop dusting  charter flights  traffic reporting  police air patrols and forest fire fighting  Each country regulates aviation differently  but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved  Many small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market  with a focus on private aviation and flight training  The most important recent developments which   when   for small aircraft  which form the bulk of the GA fleet  have been the introduction of advanced avionics  including GPS  that were formerly found only in large airliners  and the introduction of composite materials to make small aircraft lighter and faster  Ultralight and homebuilt aircraft have also become increasingly popular for recreational use  since in most countries that allow private aviation  they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft   Military aviation edit  Main articles  Military aviation and Aerial warfare The Lockheed SR    remains unsurpassed in many areas of performance      which   Simple balloons were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the   th century  Over the years  military aircraft have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements  Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their government s arsenal  Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost  performance and the speed of production   Types of military aviation edit  Fighter aircraft s primary function is to destroy other aircraft  Examples  the F     Eurofighter Typhoon  F     MiG     Su     and the F     Ground attack aircraft are used against tactical Earth bound targets  Examples  the Panavia Tornado  A     Il    J    Orao  AH    and the Su     Bombers are generally used against more strategic targets  such as factories and oil fields  Examples  the B    Tu     Mirage IV  and the B     Transport aircraft are used to transport hardware and personnel  Examples  the C    Globemaster III  C     Hercules and the Mil Mi     Surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft obtain information about enemy forces  Examples  the RC      E    U    OH    and the MiG   R  Unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs  are used primarily as reconnaissance fixed wing aircraft  though many also carry payloads  Examples  the MQ    RQ    and MQ  C Gray Eagle   Cargo aircraft are in development  as of   Missiles deliver warheads  normally explosives  Air safety edit  Main article  Aviation safety Aviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities  related to  or in direct support of the operation of aircraft  are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level  It encompasses the theory  practice  investigation  and categorization of flight failures  and the prevention of such failures through regulation  education  and training  It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel   Aviation MRO edit  A maintenance  repair  and overhaul organization  MRO  is a firm that ensures airworthiness or air transport  According to a      article   maintenance  M  involves inspecting  cleaning  oiling  and changing aircraft parts after a certain number of flight hours  Repair  R  is restoring the original function of parts and components  Overhaul  O  refers to extensive maintenance  the complete refurbishment of the aircraft  and upgrades in avionics  which can take several weeks to complete       Airlines are legally obligated to certify airworthiness  meaning that a civil aviation authority must approve an aircraft suitable for safe flight operations      MRO firms are responsible for this process  thoroughly checking and documenting all components  repairs while tracking mechanical  propulsion  and electronic parts      Aviation regulators oversee maintenance practices in the country of aircraft registration  manufacture  or current location  All aircraft maintenance activities must adhere to international regulations that mandate standards           Aviation accidents and incidents edit  Main article  Aviation accidents and incidents A USAF Thunderbird pilot ejecting from his F    aircraft at an air show in       An aviation accident is defined by the Convention on International Civil Aviation Annex    as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked  in which a person is fatally or seriously injured  the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible      An accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off  or in which the plane is destroyed  is called a hull loss accident      The first fatal aviation accident occurred in a Wright Model A aircraft at Fort Myer  now part of Joint Base Myer Henderson Hall  in Virginia  on September           resulting in injury to the pilot  Orville Wright  and death of the passenger  Signal Corps Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge  The worst aviation accident in history was the Tenerife airport disaster on March           when     people died when two Boeing     jumbo jets  operated by Pan Am and KLM collided on a runway in Los Rodeos airport  now known as Tenerife North  An aviation incident is defined as an occurrence  other than an accident  associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations       Air traffic control edit  Main article  Air traffic control Air traffic control towers at Amsterdam Airport  Air traffic control  ATC  involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation   that is  they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision  Controllers may co ordinate position reports provided by pilots  or in high traffic areas they may use radar to see aircraft positions  Becoming an air traffic controller in the United States typically requires an associate or bachelor s degree from the Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative  The FAA also requires extensive training  along with medical examinations and background checks  Some controllers are required to work weekend  night  and holiday shifts      There are generally four different types of ATC   Center controllers  who control aircraft en route between airports  Control towers of an airport   including tower  ground control  clearance delivery  and other services   which control aircraft within a small distance  typically       km          mi  horizontal  and       m        ft  vertical   Oceanic controllers  who control aircraft over international waters between continents  generally without radar service  Terminal controllers  who control aircraft in a wider area  typically       km        mi   around busy airports  ATC is especially important for aircraft flying under instrument flight rules  IFR  when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft  However  in very high traffic areas  especially near major airports  aircraft flying under visual flight rules  VFR  are also required to follow instructions from ATC  In addition to separation from other aircraft  ATC may provide weather advisories  terrain separation  navigation assistance  and other services to pilots  depending on their workload  ATC does not control all flights  The majority of Visual Flight Rules  VFR  flights in the United States and Canada are not required to contact ATC unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport  and in many areas  such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland  air traffic control services are not available  even for IFR flights at lower altitudes   Environmental impact edit  Main article  Environmental impact of aviation Water vapor contrails left by high altitude jet airliners  These may contribute to cirrus cloud formation  Like all activities involving combustion  operating powered aircraft  from airliners to hot air balloons  releases soot and other pollutants into the atmosphere  Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide  CO   are also produced  In addition  there are environmental impacts specific to aviation  for instance    Aircraft operating at high altitudes near the tropopause  mainly large jet airliners  emit aerosols and leave contrails  both of which can increase cirrus cloud formation   cloud cover may have increased by up to      since the birth of aviation      Clouds can have both a cooling and warming effect  They reflect some of the Sun s rays back into space but also block some of the heat radiated by Earth s surface  On average  both thin natural cirrus clouds and contrails have a net warming effect      Aircraft operating at high altitudes near the tropopause can also release chemicals that interact with greenhouse gases at those altitudes  particularly nitrogen compounds  which interact with ozone  increasing ozone concentrations          Most light piston aircraft burn aviation gasoline  avgas   which contains tetraethyllead  TEL   Some lower compression piston engines can operate on unleaded motor gasoline  mogas   and turbine engines and diesel engines   neither of which require lead   are appearing on some newer light aircraft  Another environmental impact of aviation is noise pollution  mainly caused by aircraft taking off and landing  Sonic booms were a problem with supersonic aircraft such as the Concorde   Innovation and development edit  Further information  Fuel economy in aircraft and Urban air mobility Technology trends in Air transportation  patent landscape in air transport  Air transportation is a mode of travel and commerce  involving the movement of people  goods  and animals through the atmosphere using aircraft such as airplanes and helicopters  It is a major mode for the overall transportation system  because of its speed and the ability to cover long distances quickly  connecting remote regions and major economic hubs  It plays a significant role in global trade and passenger mobility  influencing economic development and international relations      However  its share of CO  emissions is significant  accounting for    of global CO  emissions in       having grown faster between      and      than rail  road or shipping      Even under the High Ambition scenario  where total emissions are reduced significantly  aviation emissions will still be a major concern      The International Air Transport Association  IATA  has highlighted the need for ambitious policies in order to achieve significant reductions in aviation emissions  projecting that CO  emissions from aviation could be lowered by up to     by      with the right measures in place      The International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  also emphasizes the potential of accelerating the transition to sustainable aviation fuels  SAFs  and implementing efficiency technologies for both commercial and cargo aircraft to achieve significant emission reductions      These commitments reflect a concerted effort by global organizations to address the climate impact of the aviation sector  Two significant megatrends are observed in terms of air transport innovation  sustainability and digitalization  A report published by WIPO in      showed a steady increase of patents publication in air transportation  the majority of which being related to communication and security  followed by sustainable propulsion      Sustainable Propulsion technologies are being developed to reduce emissions and improve environmental sustainability  Efficient aircraft turbines are used to improve fuel efficiency  reduce emissions and lower noise levels  Aviation biofuels aim for a reduction in CO  emissions compared to traditional jet fuel  Battery based electric and or hybrid aircraft are being developed for short haul and regional flights  Hydrogen powered aircraft are intended for long haul flights and heavy duty applications      Automation and Circularity technologies are promoting efficient material use  smart production and robotics  and enhanced recycling practices      Communication and Security technologies are revolutionizing peacock prose  air transportation by improving operational efficiency  safety and customer experience  They include navigation technologies such as advanced air traffic management  ATM  systems  device to device technology  cloud computing  low latency internet  and cybersecurity      Analysis by McKinsey   Company has stated that the rise in digital technologies has made aviation systems more vulnerable to cyberattacks  emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures      Advanced Human  Machine Interfaces  such as extended reality technologies  speech recognition technology  facial recognition technology  touch displays and data gloves  and head up displays  are making interactions more intuitive  secure  and responsive  thereby improving operational efficiency and user experience      The air transportation sector is undergoing a surge in patenting activity  with annual Air transport related patent families increasing from under       in      to over        in        a growth of      China  the South Korea  and Japan stand out for their high patent volumes and significant growth rates  although they exhibit a relatively low Relative Specialization Index  reflecting a broad approach to innovation at the country level across various sectors  In contrast  France  the United States and Canada demonstrate a high degree of specialization in Air transportation technologies reflecting a concentrated focus on advancing specific innovations in aviation      Leading aviation companies such as RTX  General Electric  Safran  Boeing  Rolls Royce Holdings  and Honeywell International dominate the patent filings  The Aero Engine Corporation of China leads in recent growth with a compound annual growth rate of        Generally  Chinese patent owners exhibit strong recent growth in air transport patent  in contrast to the other top patentees  timeframe   Mitsubishi Electric in Japan is as the only non Chinese entity among the fastest growing patent owners  highlighting its strategic emphasis on Air transportation research and innovation  peacock prose  The diverse landscape underscores the dynamic interplay of high volume patenting and strategic specialization across different regions  driven by both established aviation multinationals and emerging players       See also edit   Aviation portal    Wikivoyage has a

WrightInvented          years ago        An airplane  American English   or aeroplane  Commonwealth English   informally plane  is a fixed wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine  propeller  or rocket engine     Airplanes come in a variety of sizes  shapes  and wing configurations  The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation  transportation of goods and people  military  and research  Worldwide  commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners    and transports more than     billion tonne kilometers    of cargo annually  which is less than    of the world s cargo movement     Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft  but some are designed to be remotely or computer controlled such as drones  The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in       recognized as  the first sustained and controlled heavier than air powered flight      They built on the works of George Cayley dating from       when he set forth the concept of the modern airplane  and later built and flew models and successful passenger carrying gliders     and the work of German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal  who  between      and       also studied heavier than air flight  Lilienthal s flight attempts in      are seen as the beginning of human flight     Following its limited use in World War I  aircraft technology continued to develop  Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II  The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He     in       The first jet airliner  the de Havilland Comet  was introduced in       The Boeing      the first widely successful commercial jet  was in commercial service for more than    years  from      to            Etymology and usage First attested in English in the late   th century  prior to the first sustained powered flight   the word airplane  like aeroplane  derives from the French a roplane  which comes from the Greek      a r    air     and either Latin planus   level       or Greek         planos    wandering            A roplane  originally referred just to the wing  as it is a plane moving through the air      In an example of synecdoche  the word for the wing came to refer to the entire aircraft  In the United States and Canada  the term  airplane  is used for powered fixed wing aircraft  In the United Kingdom and Ireland and most of the Commonwealth  the term  aeroplane       r ple n       is usually applied to these aircraft   History Main articles  Aviation history and First flying machine Le Bris and his glider  Albatros II  photographed by Nadar       Otto Lilienthal in mid flight  Berlin  c       Antecedents Many stories from antiquity involve flight  such as the Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus  and the Vimana in ancient Indian epics  Around     BC in Greece  Archytas was reputed to have designed and built the first artificial  self propelled flying device  a bird shaped model propelled by a jet of what was probably steam  said to have flown some     m      ft           This machine may have been suspended for its flight          Some of the earliest recorded attempts with gliders were those by the  th century Andalusian and Arabic language poet Abbas ibn Firnas and the   th century English monk Eilmer of Malmesbury  both experiments injured their pilots      Leonardo da Vinci researched the wing design of birds and designed a man powered aircraft in his Codex on the Flight of Birds         noting for the first time the distinction between the center of mass and the center of pressure of flying birds  In       George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed wing flying machine with separate systems for lift  propulsion  and control          Cayley was building and flying models of fixed wing aircraft as early as       and he built a successful passenger carrying glider in          In       Frenchman Jean Marie Le Bris made the first powered flight  by having his glider  L Albatros artificiel  pulled by a horse on a beach      Then the Russian Alexander F  Mozhaisky also made some innovative designs  In       the American John J  Montgomery made a controlled flight in a glider      Other aviators who made similar flights at that time were Otto Lilienthal  Percy Pilcher  and Octave Chanute  Sir Hiram Maxim built a craft that weighed     tons  with a     foot     m  wingspan that was powered by two     horsepower      kW  steam engines driving two propellers  In       his machine was tested with overhead rails to prevent it from rising  The test showed that it had enough lift to take off  The craft was uncontrollable and it is presumed that Maxim realized this because he subsequently abandoned work on it      Between      and       the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed heavier than air flight  He was the first person to make well documented  repeated  successful gliding flights  Lilienthal s work led to him developing the concept of the modern wing          his flight attempts in      are seen as the beginning of human flight      the  Lilienthal Normalsegelapparat  is considered to be the first airplane in series production and his work heavily inspired the Wright brothers      In the     s  Lawrence Hargrave conducted research on wing structures and developed a box kite that lifted the weight of a man  His box kite designs were widely adopted  Although he also developed a type of rotary aircraft engine  he did not create and fly a powered fixed wing aircraft       Early powered flights Patent drawings of Clement Ader s  ole  The Frenchman Clement Ader constructed his first of three flying machines in       the  ole  It was a bat like design run by a lightweight steam engine of his own invention  with four cylinders developing    horsepower     kW   driving a four blade propeller  The engine weighed no more than   kilograms per kilowatt      lb hp   The wings had a

aeronautics  as  the first sustained and controlled heavier than air powered flight      By       the Wright Flyer III was capable of fully controllable  stable flight for substantial periods  The Wright brothers credited Otto Lilienthal as a major inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight   Santos Dumont    bis  between      and      In       the Brazilian Alberto Santos Dumont made what was claimed to be the first airplane flight unassisted by catapult     and set the first world record recognized by the A ro Club de France by flying     meters      ft  in less than    seconds      This flight was also certified by the FAI          An early aircraft design that brought together the modern monoplane tractor configuration was the Bl riot VIII design of       It had movable tail surfaces controlling both yaw and pitch  a form of roll control supplied either by wing warping or by ailerons and controlled by its pilot with a joystick and rudder bar  It was an important predecessor of his later Bl riot XI Channel crossing aircraft of the summer of           World War I served as a testbed for the use of the airplane as a weapon  Airplanes demonstrated their potential as mobile observation platforms  then proved themselves to be machines of war capable of causing casualties to the enemy  The earliest known aerial victory with a synchronized machine gun armed fighter aircraft occurred in       by German Luftstreitkr fte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens  Fighter aces appeared  the greatest  by number of Aerial Combat victories  was Manfred von Richthofen  also known as the Red Baron  Following WWI  aircraft technology continued to develop  Alcock and Brown crossed the Atlantic non stop for the first time in       The first international commercial flights took place between the United States and Canada in            North American P    Mustang  a World War II fighter aircraft Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II  They were an essential component of the military strategies of the period  such as the German Blitzkrieg  The Battle of Britain  and the American and Japanese aircraft carrier campaigns of the Pacific War   Development of jet aircraft The first practical jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He      which was tested in       In       the Messerschmitt Me      the first operational jet fighter aircraft  went into service in the German Luftwaffe   American Airlines Boeing         landing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in July      The first jet airliner  the de Havilland Comet  was introduced in       The Boeing      the first widely successful commercial jet  was in commercial service for more than    years  from      to       The Boeing     was the world s biggest passenger aircraft from      until it was surpassed by the Airbus A    in        The Concorde supersonic transport aircraft Supersonic airliner flights  including those of the Concorde  have been limited to over water flight at supersonic speed because of their sonic boom  which is prohibited over most populated land areas  The high cost of operation per passenger mile and a deadly crash in      induced the operators of the Concorde to remove it from service           Propulsion See also  Powered aircraft and Aircraft engine Propeller Main articles  Propeller  aeronautics  and Aircraft engine An Antonov An   biplane An aircraft propeller  or airscrew  converts rotary motion from an engine or other power source  into a swirling slipstream which pushes the propeller forwards or backwards  It comprises a rotating power driven hub  to which are attached two or more radial airfoil section blades such that the whole assembly rotates about a longitudinal axis      Three types of aviation engines used to power propellers include reciprocating engines  or piston engines   gas turbines  and electric motors  The amount of thrust a propeller creates is determined  in part  by its disk area the area through which the blades rotate  The limitation on blade speed is the speed of sound  as when the blade tip exceeds the speed of sound  shock waves decrease propeller efficiency  The rpm required to generate a given tip speed is inversely proportional to the diameter of the propeller  The upper design speed limit for propeller driven aircraft is Mach      Aircraft designed to go faster than that employ jet engines       Reciprocating engine Main articles  Radial engine  Inline engine  aeronautics   and Flat engine Reciprocating engines in aircraft have three main variants  radial  in line and flat or horizontally opposed engine  The radial engine is a reciprocating type internal combustion engine configuration in which the cylinders  radiate  outward from a central crankcase like the spokes of a wheel and was commonly used for aircraft engines before gas turbine engines became predominant  An inline engine is a reciprocating engine with banks of cylinders  one behind another  rather than rows of cylinders  with each bank having any number of cylinders  but rarely more than six  and may be water cooled  A flat engine is an internal combustion engine with horizontally opposed cylinders   Gas turbine Main article  Turboprop A turboprop gas turbine engine consists of an intake  compressor  combustor  turbine  and a propelling nozzle  which provide power from a shaft through a reduction gearing to the propeller  The propelling nozzle provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop   Electric motor Solar Impulse    a solar powered aircraft with electric motors  Main article  Electric motor An electric aircraft runs on electric motors with electricity coming from fuel cells  solar cells  ultracapacitors  power beaming      or batteries  Currently  flying electric aircraft are mostly experimental prototypes  including manned and unmanned aerial vehicles  but there are some production models on the market       Jet Main article  Jet engineJet aircraft are propelled by jet engines  which are used because the aerodynamic limitations of propellers do not apply to jet propulsion  These engines are much more powerful than a reciprocating engine for a given size or weight and are comparatively quiet and work well at higher altitude  Variants of the jet engine include the ramjet and the scramjet  which rely on high airspeed and intake geometry to compress the combustion air  prior to the introduction and ignition of fuel  Rocket motors provide thrust by burning a fuel with an oxidizer and expelling gas through a nozzle  Turbofan Most jet aircraft use turbofan jet engines  which employ a gas turbine to drive a ducted fan  which accelerates air around the turbine to provide thrust in addition to that which is accelerated through the turbine  The ratio of air passing around the turbine to that passing through is called the by pass ratio      They represent a compromise between turbojet  with no bypass  and turboprop forms of aircraft propulsion  primarily powered with bypass air       Subsonic aircraft  such as airliners  employ high by pass jet engines for fuel efficiency  Supersonic aircraft  such as jet fighters  use low bypass turbofans  However at supersonic speeds  the air entering the engine must be decelerated to a subsonic speed and then re accelerated back to supersonic speeds after combustion  An afterburner may be used on combat aircraft to increase power for short periods of time by injecting fuel directly into the hot exhaust gases  Many jet aircraft also use thrust reversers to slow down after landing       Ramjet Main article  Ramjet Artist s concept of X   A with scramjet attached to the underside A ramjet is a form of jet engine that contains no major moving parts and can be particularly useful in applications requiring a small and simple engine for high speed use  such as with missiles  Ramjets require forward motion before they can generate thrust and so are often used in conjunction with other forms of propulsion  or with an external means of achieving sufficient speed  The Lockheed D    was a Mach    ramjet powered reconnaissance drone that was launched from a parent aircraft  A ramjet uses the vehicle s forward motion to force air through the engine without resorting to turbines or vanes  Fuel is added and ignited  which heats and expands the air to provide thrust       Scramjet Main article  Scramjet A scramjet is a specialized ramjet that uses internal supersonic airflow to compress  combine with fuel  combust and accelerate the exhaust to provide thrust  The engine operates at supersonic speeds only  The NASA X     an experimental unmanned scramjet  set a world speed record in      for a jet powered aircraft with a speed of Mach      nearly        kilometers per hour        mph        Rocket Main article  Rocket engine Bell X   in flight       Whereas jet aircraft use the atmosphere both as a source of oxidant and of mass to accelerate reactively behind the aircraft  rocket aircraft carry the oxidizer on board and accelerate the burned fuel and oxidizer backwards as the sole source of mass for reaction  Liquid fuel and oxidizer may be pumped into a combustion chamber or a solid fuel with oxidizer may burn in the fuel chamber  Whether liquid or solid fueled  the hot gas is accelerated through a nozzle      In World War II  the Germans deployed the Me     Komet rocket powered aircraft  The first plane to break the sound barrier in level flight was a rocket plane   the Bell X   in       The North American X    broke many speed and altitude records in the     s and pioneered engineering concepts for later aircraft and spacecraft  Military transport aircraft may employ rocket assisted take offs for short field situations  Otherwise  rocket aircraft include spaceplanes  like SpaceShipTwo  for travel beyond the Earth s atmosphere and sport aircraft developed for the short lived Rocket Racing League   Design and manufacture Main article  Aerospace manufacturer Assembly line of the SR    Blackbird at Skunk Works  Lockheed Martin s Advanced Development Programs  ADP   Most airplanes are constructed by companies with the objective of producing them in quantity for customers  The design and planning process  including safety tests  can last up to four years for small turboprops or longer for larger planes  During this process  the objectives and design specifications of the aircraft are established  First the construction company uses drawings and equations  simulations  wind tunnel tests and experience to predict the behavior of the aircraft  Computers are used by companies to draw  plan and do initial simulations of the aircraft  Small models and mockups of all or certain parts of the plane are then tested in wind tunnels to verify its aerodynamics  When the design has passed through these processes  the company constructs a limited number of prototypes for testing on the ground  Representatives from an aviation governing agency often make a first flight  The flight tests continue until the aircraft has fulfilled all the requirements  Then  the governing public agency of aviation of the country authorizes the company to begin production  In the United States  this agency is the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA   In the European Union  European Aviation Safety Agency  EASA   in the United Kingdom it is the Civil Aviation Authority  CAA       In Canada  the public agency in charge and authorizing the mass production of aircraft is Transport Canada s Civil Aviation Authority      When a part or component needs to be joined together by welding for virtually any aerospace or defense application  it must meet the most stringent and specific safety regulations and standards  Nadcap  or the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program sets global requirements for quality  quality management and quality assurance for aerospace engineering      In the case of international sales  a license from the public agency of aviation or transport of the country where the aircraft is to be used is also necessary  For example  airplanes made by the European company Airbus need to be certified by the FAA to be flown in the United States  and airplanes made by U S  based Boeing need to be approved by the EASA to be flown in the European Union       An Airbus A    on final assembly line   in the Airbus Hamburg Finkenwerder plant  Regulations have resulted in reduced noise from aircraft engines in response to increased noise pollution from growth in air traffic over urban areas near airports      Small planes can be designed and constructed by amateurs as homebuilts  Other homebuilt aircraft can be assembled using pre manufactured kits of parts that can be assembled into a basic plane and must then be completed by the builder      Few companies produce planes on a large scale  However  the production of a plane for one company is a process that actually involves dozens  or even hundreds  of other companies and plants  that produce the parts that go into the plane  For example  one company can be responsible for the production of the landing gear  while another one is responsible for the radar  The production of such parts is not limited to the same city or country  in the case of large plane manufacturing companies  such parts can come from all over the world  The parts are sent to the main plant of the plane company  where the production line is located  In the case of large planes  production lines dedicated to the assembly of certain parts of the plane can exist  especially the wings and the fuselage          When complete  a plane is rigorously inspected to search for imperfections and defects  After approval by inspectors  the plane is put through a series of flight tests to assure that all systems are working correctly and that the plane handles properly      To meet a particular customer need  the airplane may be customised using components or packages of components provided by the manufacturer or the customer       Characteristics Major components of an airplane  An IAI Heron   an unmanned aerial vehicle with a twin boom configuration Airframe Main article  Airframe The structural parts of a fixed wing aircraft are called the airframe  The parts present can vary according to the aircraft s type and purpose  Early types were usually made of wood with fabric wing surfaces  When engines became available for powered flight around a hundred years ago  their mounts were made of metal  Then as speeds increased more and more parts became metal until by the end of WWII all metal aircraft were common  In modern times  increasing use of composite materials has been made  Typical structural parts include   One or more large horizontal wings  often with an airfoil cross section shape  The wing deflects air downward as the aircraft moves forward  generating lifting force to support it in flight  The wing also provides stability in roll to stop the aircraft from rolling to the left or right in steady flight  The An     Mriya  which could carry a     tonne payload  had two vertical stabilizers  A fuselage  a long  thin body  usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape aerodynamically smooth  The fuselage joins the other parts of the airframe and usually contains important things such as the pilot  payload and flight systems  A vertical stabilizer or fin is a vertical wing like surface mounted at the rear of the plane and typically protruding above it  The fin stabilizes the plane s yaw  turn left or right  and mounts the rudder  which controls its rotation along that axis  A horizontal stabilizer or tailplane  usually mounted at the tail near the vertical stabilizer  The horizontal stabilizer is used to stabilize the plane s pitch  tilt up or down  and mounts the elevators  which provide pitch control  Landing gear  a set of wheels  skids  or floats that support the plane while it is on the surface  On seaplanes  the bottom of the fuselage or floats  pontoons  support it while on the water  On some planes the landing gear retracts during flight to reduce drag  Wings Main article  Wing The wings of a fixed wing aircraft are static planes extending either side of the aircraft  When the aircraft travels forwards  air flows over the wings  which are shaped to create lift  This shape is called an airfoil and is shaped like a bird s wing   Wing structure Airplanes have flexible wing surfaces which are stretched across a frame and made rigid by the lift forces exerted by the airflow over them  Larger aircraft have rigid wing surfaces which provide additional strength  Whether flexible or rigid  most wings have a strong frame to give them their shape and to transfer lift from the wing surface to the rest of the aircraft  The main structural elements are one or more spars running from root to tip  and many ribs running from the leading  front  to the trailing  rear  edge  Early airplane engines had little power  and lightness was very important  Also  early airfoil sections were very thin  and could not have a strong frame installed within  So  until the     s  most wings were too lightweight to have enough strength  and external bracing struts and wires were added  When the available engine power increased during the     s and   s  wings could be made heavy and strong enough that bracing was not needed any more  This type of unbraced wing is called a cantilever wing   Wing configuration Main article  Wing configuration Captured Morane Saulnier L wire braced parasol monoplane The number and shape of the wings varies widely on different types  A given wing plane may be full span or divided by a central fuselage into port  left  and starboard  right  wings  Occasionally  even more wings have been used  with the three winged triplane achieving some fame in WWI  The four winged quadruplane and other multiplane designs have had little success  A monoplane has a single wing plane  a biplane has two stacked one above the other  a tandem wing has two placed one behind the other  When the available engine power increased during the     s and   s and bracing was no longer needed  the unbraced or cantilever monoplane became the most common form of powered type  The wing planform is the shape when seen from above  To be aerodynamically efficient  a wing should be straight with a long span from side to side but have a short chord  high aspect ratio   But to be structurally efficient  and hence light weight  a wing must have a short span but still enough area to provide lift  low aspect ratio   At transonic speeds  near the speed of sound   it helps to sweep the wing backwards or forwards to reduce drag from supersonic shock waves as they begin to form  The swept wing is just a straight wing swept backwards or forwards   Two Dassault Mirage G prototypes  one with wings swept The delta wing is a triangle shape that may be used for several reasons  As a flexible Rogallo wing  it allows a stable shape under aerodynamic forces and so is often used for ultralight aircraft and even kites  As a supersonic wing  it combines high strength with low drag and so is often used for fast jets  A variable geometry wing can be changed in flight to a different shape  The variable sweep wing transforms between an efficient straight configuration for takeoff and landing  to a low drag swept configuration for high speed flight  Other forms of variable planform have been flown  but none have gone beyond the research stage   Fuselage Main article  Fuselage A fuselage is a long  thin body  usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape aerodynamically smooth  The fuselage may contain the flight crew  passengers  cargo or payload  fuel and engines  The pilots of manned aircraft operate them from a cockpit located at the front or top of the fuselage and equipped with controls and usually windows and instruments  A plane may have more than one fuselage  or it may be fitted with booms with the tail located between the booms to allow the extreme rear of the fuselage to be useful for a variety of purposes   Wings vs  bodies Flying wing Main article  Flying wing The US produced B   Spirit is a strategic bomber  It has a flying wing configuration and is capable of intercontinental missions A flying wing is a tailless aircraft which has no definite fuselage  Most of the crew  payload and equipment are housed inside the main wing structure      The flying wing configuration was studied extensively in the     s and     s  notably by Jack Northrop and Cheston L  Eshelman in the United States  and Alexander Lippisch and the Horten brothers in Germany  After the war  several experimental designs were based on the flying wing concept  but the known difficulties remained intractable  Some general interest continued until the early     s but designs did not necessarily offer a great advantage in range and presented several technical problems  leading to the adoption of  conventional  solutions like the Convair B    and the B    Stratofortress  Due to the practical need for a deep wing  the flying wing concept is most practical for designs in the slow to medium speed range  and there has been continual interest in using it as a tactical airlifter design  Interest in flying wings was renewed in the     s due to their potentially low radar reflection cross sections  Stealth technology relies on shapes which only reflect radar waves in certain directions  thus making the aircraft hard to detect unless the radar receiver is at a specific position relative to the aircraft   a position that changes continuously as the aircraft moves  This approach eventually led to the Northrop B   Spirit stealth bomber  In this case  the aerodynamic advantages of the flying wing are not the primary needs  However  modern computer controlled fly by wire systems allowed for many of the aerodynamic drawbacks of the flying wing to be minimized  making for an efficient and stable long range bomber   Blended wing body Main article  Blended wing Computer generated model of the Boeing X    Blended wing body aircraft have a flattened and airfoil shaped body  which produces most of the lift to keep itself aloft  and distinct and separate wing structures  though the wings are smoothly blended in with the body  Thus blended wing bodied aircraft incorporate design features from both a futuristic fuselage and flying wing design  The purported advantages of the blended wing body approach are efficient high lift wings and a wide airfoil shaped body  This enables the entire craft to contribute to lift generation with the result of potentially increased fuel economy   Lifting body The Martin Aircraft Company X    was built as part of a      to      experimental US military program  Main article  Lifting body A lifting body is a configuration in which the body itself produces lift  In contrast to a flying wing  which is a wing with minimal or no conventional fuselage  a lifting body can be thought of as a fuselage with little or no conventional wing  Whereas a flying wing seeks to maximize cruise efficiency at subsonic speeds by eliminating non lifting surfaces  lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a wing for subsonic  supersonic  and hypersonic flight  or  spacecraft re entry  All of these flight regimes pose challenges for proper flight stability  Lifting bodies were a major area of research in the     s and     s as a means to build a small and lightweight crewed spacecraft  The US built several famous lifting body rocket planes to test the concept  as well as several rocket launched re entry vehicles that were tested over the Pacific  Interest waned as the US Air Force lost interest in the crewed mission  and major development ended during the Space Shuttle design process when it became clear that the highly shaped fuselages made it difficult to fit fuel tankage   Empennage and foreplane Main articles  Empennage and Canard  aeronautics  Canards on the Saab Viggen The classic airfoil section wing is unstable in flight and difficult to control  Flexible wing types often rely on an anchor line or the weight of a pilot hanging beneath to maintain the correct attitude  Some free flying types use an adapted airfoil that is stable  or other ingenious mechanisms including  most recently  electronic artificial stability  To achieve stability and control  most fixed wing types have an empennage comprising a fin and rudder which act horizontally and a tailplane and elevator which act vertically  These control surfaces can typically be trimmed to relieve control forces for various stages of flight  This is so common that it is known as the conventional layout  Sometimes there may be two or more fins  spaced out along the tailplane  Some types have a horizontal  canard  foreplane ahead of the main wing  instead of behind it              This foreplane may contribute to the lift  the trim  or control of the aircraft  or to several of these   Controls and instruments Main article  Aircraft flight control system A light aircraft  Robin DR         cockpit Further information  Fixed wing aircraft   Aircraft controls  and Fixed wing aircraft   Cockpit instrumentation Airplanes have complex flight control systems  The main controls allow the pilot to direct the aircraft in the air by controlling the attitude  roll  pitch and yaw  and engine thrust  On manned aircraft  cockpit instruments provide information to the pilots  including flight data  engine output  navigation  communications and other aircraft systems that may be installed   Safety Main article  Aviation safety When risk is measured by deaths per passenger kilometer  air travel is approximately    times safer than travel by bus or rail  However  when using the deaths per journey statistic  air travel is significantly more dangerous than car  rail  or bus travel      Air travel insurance is relatively expensive for this reason insurers generally use the deaths per journey statistic      There is a significant difference between the safety of airliners and that of smaller private planes  with the per mile statistic indicating that airliners are     times safer than smaller planes       Environmental impact Main article  Environmental impact of aviation Water vapor contrails left by high altitude jet airliners  These may contribute to cirrus cloud formation  Like all activities involving combustion  fossil fuel powered aircraft release soot and other pollutants into the atmosphere  Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide  CO   are also produced  In addition  there are environmental impacts specific to airplanes  for instance    Airplanes operating at high altitudes near the tropopause  mainly large jet airliners  emit aerosols and leave contrails  both of which can increase cirrus cloud formation   cloud cover may have increased by up to      since the birth of aviation      Airplanes operating at high altitudes near the tropopause can also release chemicals that interact with greenhouse gases at those altitudes  particularly nitrogen compounds  which interact with ozone  increasing ozone concentrations          Most light piston aircraft burn avgas  which contains tetraethyllead  TEL   Some lower compression piston engines can operate on unleaded mogas and turbine engines and diesel engines   neither of which require lead   are used on some newer light aircraft  Some non polluting light electric aircraft are already in production  Another environmental impact of airplanes is noise pollution  mainly caused by aircraft taking off and landing   See also Aircraft flight mechanics Aviation Fuel efficiency List of altitude records reached by different aircraft types Rotorcraft References      Code of Federal Regulations     CFR Part

operations on   November      and operated a fleet of Airbus A    aircraft in an all economy configuration  In       the airline planned to launch an IPO to raise     billion  US     million   In       the airline faced difficulties with the availability of Pratt   Whitney engines used on its entire fleet of A    aircraft  alleging that the problem was impacting its operations  Subsequently  the airline ceased operations on   May      and filed for voluntary insolvency with the National Company Law Tribunal    History edit  GoAir was founded in      by Jehangir Wadia  son of Indian industrialist Nusli Wadia  The airline is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wadia Group     GoAir commenced its operations using an Airbus A    aircraft and operated its inaugural flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad on   November          The airline initially operated with a single aircraft to four destinations  including Goa and Coimbatore  with plans to induct    aircraft by          In March       the airline announced revised plans to operate    aircraft and service new destinations in the North East and South India by the end of the year     However  increasing fuel prices forced GoAir to cut down the existing number of flights in June          In January       British Airways was interested in buying a stake in the airline     In November       GoAir entered into talks with Indian airline SpiceJet over a possible merger  but the discussions ended without a deal     In April       GoAir became the fifth largest airline in India in terms of market share following the demise of Kingfisher Airlines        In       the airline appointed investment bank JP Morgan to scout for potential investors       A Go First Airbus A        in its former GoAir livery        The airline s growth was slow compared to other airlines established around the same time  such as IndiGo and SpiceJet  which had larger market shares  fleet sizes  and more destinations served by           According to the airline  it was a planned strategy due to the tough aviation environment in India  focusing on maintaining profitability rather than capturing market share or increasing the number of destinations and fleet size          In February       it was the fifth largest carrier in the country with an    market share      The airline was planning an initial public offering in           It took delivery of its   th aircraft in June       making it eligible to operate international flights      GoAir became the sixth Indian domestic carrier to fly internationally when it launched its inaugural flight to Phuket from Delhi on    October           On    March       amidst the COVID    pandemic  GoAir suspended all its international flights      On    May       GoAir was rebranded as Go First      In       the airline once again planned to launch an IPO to raise     billion  US     million           In       the airline faced operational issues  resulting in the cancellation of multiple flights      The airline claimed to have been largely impacted by supply chain issues with Pratt   Whitney PW    G engines  which power its entire fleet of A   neo aircraft  Subsequently  the airline filed for voluntary insolvency resolution before the National Company Law Tribunal  NCLT  on   May           The airline also sued Pratt   Whitney in a United States federal court  seeking to enforce an arbitral award directing the supply of engines as contracted      Pratt   Whitney disputed these claims      The airline sought interim directions from NCLT to continue functioning and requested restrictions on any adverse regulatory action  but this was denied  Owing to non payment of rental dues  leasing companies repossessed the airline s leased planes      On    June       the airline s creditors approved an interim financing of      crore  US    million  aimed at returning it to operation  pending board approval      In mid August       the airline sought emergency funding of      crore  US    million  to keep itself afloat      On    February       it was announced that Go First had received a    day extension for its insolvency resolution process  allowing potential investors to submit their proposals for the carrier s revival  This was the second extension given to Go First  and also the last one it could expect  The airline attracted interest from multiple investors  including SpiceJet      As of February       Ajay Singh  the Chairman and Managing Director of SpiceJet  along with Nishant Pitti  majority stakeholder of Busy Bee Airways and co founder of EaseMyTrip  submitted a bid for GoFirst amounting to      crore  US    million   The total dues of Go First including claims from vendors and lessors were pegged at         crore  US     billion   which they planned to pay off by  monetising  two land parcel owned by Go First in Mumbai  According to the bid  Nishant Pitti would hold a majority stake of      with the remaining shares held by Ajay Singh  They planned to start operations using    aircraft  There was also another bidder for the airline  Sharjah based Sky One FZE      On   May       the Directorate General of Civil Aviation deregistered all    aircraft leased to Go First following a Delhi High Court order issued on    April  After filing for bankruptcy in May       the lessors of these aircraft have since been engaged in a fierce battle with the former owner of the airline  lenders  and the resolution professional to regain control of their aircraft       Corporate affairs edit  The airline was headquartered in the Wadia

cost carrier with the objective of providing convenient connectivity to short haul international routes in the Middle East and Southeast Asia for the Indian expatriate community  Air India Express was Air India s response to the growing popularity of low cost carriers worldwide and within the region  As a low cost carrier  the airline operates point to point flights with multiple hubs all over

over     of its total revenue within the next few years              The merger of AIX Connect and Air India Express was declared complete on   October           By the time  the fleet size is to

CEOEmployees      Websitewww zooom aero Zexus Air Services  doing business as Zooom Air  was an Indian low cost regional airline headquartered in Gurugram  Haryana  India  It operates from its base at Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi  with a fleet of   aircraft          History edit  was established in April      as  Zexus Air  by Zexus Air Services Pvt  Ltd  The Ministry of Civil Aviation issued it a No Objection Certificate  NOC  along with five other airline startups in July          In September       the airline took delivery of its first aircraft  a Bombardier CRJ        The airline received its air operator s certificate  AOC  on   February       and began flight operations on    February from Delhi to Kolkata  with a stop at Durgapur       Operational difficulties and cessation of operations edit  Although the airline initially started its operations with a considerable response under the government s UDAN Scheme  it could not last longer due to declining passengers and patronage  So  in July       the operating license of the airline was suspended by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation  DGCA  due to safety concerns      The DGCA then revived the airline s AOC in December       and it was expected that the airline will restart operations in January           All operations were suspended until    October       when the airline restarted operations       However  all operations were grounded indefinitely in March      due to the COVID    pandemic  The airline was supposed to resume operations again in January       with no success  It began to be involved with insolvency over unpaid dues due to grounding  because an expatriate pilot associated with the company filed an application in the National Company Law Tribunal  NCLT  court as an operational creditor  The NCLT considered the report on    March       along with appointing an interim resolution professional  All operational and financial creditors were asked to submit their claims before   April of the same year  The insolvency proceedings were completed after     days from the date of commencement of the proceedings  i e   on    September            Restart edit  On    September       the DGCA received its AOC again to restart operations normally      Hence  in December       the airline announced it would start flights from the first week of January      in the Delhi Ayodhya Lucknow Ayodhya Delhi route      Finally  it restarted operations on    January       by starting direct flights from Delhi to Ayodhya  while flights to Amritsar  Chandigarh and Lucknow will be launched in the coming months                The airline again stopped bookings for its Delhi Ayodhya route in June        Corporate affairs edit  Zooom Air is the brand name for Zexus

Airport in Tokyo  Japan in      A Volga Dnepr Airlines An     cargo aircraft ready for loading in      Global air transport by country and freight level as of       ton km     Air cargo is any property carried or to be carried in an aircraft  Air cargo comprises air freight  air express and airmail       Aircraft types edit  Different cargo can be transported by passenger  cargo or combi aircraft   Passenger aircraft use the spare volume in the airplane s baggage hold  the  belly   that is not being used for passenger luggage a common practice used by passenger airlines  who additionally transport cargo on scheduled passenger flights  Cargo can also be transported in the passenger cabin as hand carry by an  on board courier    This practice can often be used to cross subsidise loss making passenger routes that would otherwise be uneconomical to operate  A passenger aircraft can also be used as a preighter in which the entire passenger cabin is temporarily dedicated to carrying freight  Cargo aircraft are dedicated for the job they carry freight on the main deck and in the belly by means of nose loading or side loading  Combi aircraft carry cargo on part of the main deck  before or after a passengers  section  with side loading  and in the belly  History edit    th century edit  Loading airmail cargo in Detroit in the late     s A Douglas C    at Berlin Tempelhof Airport during the Berlin Blockade in      The first cargo flight took place on the   November      in the U S  between Dayton and Columbus in Ohio  Philip Orin Parmelee piloted a Wright Model B aeroplane    miles      km  carrying a package of     pounds of silk for the opening of a store  Newspaper clippings quoted the Wright brothers as stating he covered the distance in    minutes  but the flight was officially recorded at    minutes  a world speed record at the time  It was the first  cargo only  flight solely for the transport of goods  the first flight commissioned by a client  and the first example of multimodal air transport  since the pieces of silk were transported by car from Columbus aerodrome to the store  The world s first official airmail flight by airplane took place on    February       at a large exhibition in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh  British India  The organizer of the aviation display  Walter Windham  was able to secure permission from the postmaster general in India to operate an airmail service in order to generate publicity for the exhibition and to raise money for charity  This first airmail flight was piloted by Henri Pequet  who flew       letters a distance of    km      mi   from Allahabad to Naini the nearest station on the Bombay Calcutta line to the exhibition  The aircraft used was a Humber Sommer biplane with about fifty horsepower     kW   and it made the journey in thirteen minutes  The world s first scheduled airmail post service took place in the United Kingdom between the London suburb of Hendon  and the Postmaster General s office in Windsor  Berkshire  on September          It was part of the celebrations for King George V s coronation and at the suggestion of Windham  who based his proposal on the successful experiment he had overseen in India  The service ran for just under a month  transporting    bags of mail in    flights  In the early     s  air cargo developed rapidly because numerous entrepreneurs realized aircraft could move high value and low volume consignments much faster than the railroads and shipping companies  The first scheduled flight from London to Paris in      had only one passenger  but carried leather for a shoe manufacturer and grouse for a restaurant  Cinema films were also a frequent consignment  original news  bulletins were first carried to a central laboratory to make copies  and then distributed by air throughout Europe for their release in cinemas  Although there were a few attempts to organize air freight airlines from the     s on  the first commercial airlines that were all cargo did not emerge until after World War II   World War II edit  In       at a conference in Havana     airlines formed the International Air Transport Association  In       Berlin was jointly controlled by the Western Allies and Soviet Union  although the Soviet Union held the area surrounding the city and thus land access  During the Berlin Blockade  this land access was closed  and an airlift remained the only option to get increasingly urgent deliveries of food  coal  and other supplies to West Berlin  Over     days to    May      a total of      million tons of cargo were airlifted to Berlin  an average of       tons a day      by the US and     by the UK      Post World War II edit  Although freight traffic developed modestly  reaching only         tonnes worldwide by the mid     s  the world economy was hitting its post World War II stride  Germany and Japan were emerging from their period of purgatory and were poised to take the world of business by storm  the United States was approaching the height of its economic dominance  and Western Europe had recovered from the war  In       Boeing launched the four engine      the first wide body aircraft  The     was the first aircraft capable of transporting full pallets in the cargo hold  revolutionizing the air cargo industry  Despite widespread hopes for a vibrant industry  for decades the air freight sector did not grow as expected and remained a very small part of total air traffic  For much of the first five post war decades  most carriers saw it as a secondary activity  although there had always been specialized cargo airlines  Some passenger airlines have found the practice of carrying belly cargo to be a highly lucrative enterprise  in fact  it is estimated that     of all air freight is moved in this way  to the point where it has lessened the demand for dedicated large cargo aircraft         Cargo emerged as a solid pillar of the industry in the     s  The catalysts for the renewed growth in the sector were the express parcel carriers  typified by FedEx  DHL  PostNL  and UPS  and changes in practices in the manufacturing sector  In       FedEx sent software on computer disks to thousands of customers  allowing them to track shipments from their own workstations     st century edit  A FedEx Boeing      a UPS Boeing          and a DHL tail cargo planes at Cologne Bonn Airport in      The rise of internet in the years that followed contributed to increase the reliability and accessibility to the air cargo industry  Most airlines now offer to their customers real time flight status and the booking and tracking options  In addition  the industry is adopting electronic procedures     such as the electronic air waybill  to reduce the amount of paper documentation accompanying each shipment and increasing the security and safety of the transportation  Many retailers are making an effort to integrate the air cargo delivery process with their customer service offering to respond to increasing consumer pressure     An industry expert estimates that       tonnes of air cargo is worth       economy passenger seats  when both are on passenger planes     However  with the exception of the integrators  FedEx  UPS  DHL and TNT  the air cargo industry continues to suffer as the by product  poor relation  of the passenger business  citation needed  In       the IATA observed a    rise in freight tonne kilometers  air cargo demand is strong due to industrial production and global trade growth above expansion of e commerce  outpacing capacity as available tonne kilometers grew by     Boeing doubled its    F production since      to three per month in          and anticipates that total global air

of a BAe     A regional airliner  commuter airliner or feeder liner is a small airliner that is designed to fly up to     passengers on short haul flights  usually feeding larger carriers  airline hubs from small markets  This class of airliners is typically flown by the regional airlines that are either contracted by or subsidiaries of the larger airlines  Regional airliners are used for short trips between smaller towns or from a larger city to a smaller city  Feeder liner  commuter  and local service are all alternative terms for the same class of flight operations       History edit  The Douglas DC   first flew in      and had a range of around       miles        kilometers   To keep short routes economical  airlines preferred using second hand aircraft than costlier new aircraft     Older aircraft were put into short haul service as they were replaced by new longer range designs   Post war era edit  Propeller aircraft of larger airlines were transferred to smaller airlines  Examples included the De Havilland Dragon Rapide biplane and the Douglas DC  s  in large surplus after the war  which the aircraft manufacturers wanted to replace  The first piston powered airliners with    seats were the Martin      s  introduced in       and Convair CV    s          Turboprop designs edit  The Fokker F   Friendship was introduced in November      The first turboprop powered aircraft emerged like the Vickers Viscount     seats  introduced in       and Fokker F          seats         Some smaller turboprop airliners were developed in the     s like the British Shorts Skyvan     seats         and French Nord         seats        or Brazilian Embraer EMB     Bandeirante         This  hand me down  process of supplying aircraft continued with designs like the Convair     and Douglas DC   also serving in this role while the first jets were introduced  By the mid     s  demand for even more economical designs led to the production of the first custom feeder liners  These were almost always turboprops  which had fuel economy on par with piston engine designs  but had far lower maintenance costs  Often  the time between engine overhaul periods was five times that of the best piston engines  Early examples of these designs include the Fokker F   Friendship  Avro      and Handley Page Dart Herald  These designs were so successful that it was to be many years before newer designs bettered them enough to make it worthwhile in terms of capital investment to develop  Among the first purpose built airliners developed for the CAB sanctioned local service airlines in the US  the predecessors of the modern regional airliner industry  was the interim and custom built Fairchild F    FH     s for the needs of these smaller but expanding airlines of the late     s  There were a few other exceptions  generally tailored to more specific roles  For instance  the Handley Page Jetstream  first flight in       was intended for fewer passengers at much higher speeds  displacing smaller designs like the Beechcraft Queen Air  The Fairchild Swearingen Metro  developed from the original Queen Air through a number of stages  filled a similar niche  By the     s  the first generation regional airliners were starting to wear out  but there had been little effort in producing new designs for this market   A varied list of light transport aircraft supplanted by newer and more modern    seat designs by Shorts with their Shorts     and     as well as other aircraft manufacturers  replaced and sometimes provided growth to established commuter markets  Additional development came to the regional airline industry with the arrival of some of the earlier De Havilland Canada types such as the Dash   delivered in       but this was tailored more to the short range and STOL  Short Take Off and Landing  role than as a regional airliner  Feedback from the airlines was fairly consistent  and De Havilland responded with the Dash   in       which had economic benefits over the earlier generation machines and was faster and quieter as well   The ATR    was introduced in October      In the early     s  the Dash   s success sparked off development of a number of similar designs  including the ATR        Saab      Embraer Brasilia and Fokker     Consequently  there were a relatively large number of aircraft offered by manufacturers in this sector of the market  pushing older     s designs from Fokker  Vickers and others into retirement  Due to the high level of competition  production of a number of these types ceased  Saab AB exited the civil aviation market and wrote its debts off  Daimler Benz Aerospace  pulled the plug  on Dornier  and British Aerospace ended production of their BAe Jetstream    after     delivered  By      only the ATR       models and the Dash   remained in production  Turboprop airliner deliveries are correlated with oil prices with a lag of a few years     In             million two way seats were offered on turboprop flights  up from       million in       with     of flights below     nmi      km  and     below     nmi      km   and an average capacity increasing to    seats from    seats in       The largest user was Air Canada with      million seats  followed by Flybe with      million and Wings Air with      million  Canada was the largest market with      million seats  then Indonesia with      and the US with       The busiest turboprop airport was Vancouver       Million seats  followed by Toronto Pearson        then Seattle Tacoma             Noise edit  Although turboprops are quiet to outside observers  prop wash makes them noisy inside     Active noise reduction should reduce the cabin noise of the Bombardier Q    or the ATR          Market forecast edit  Flight Global fleet forecasts for the           period estimate       turboprop deliveries with a     billion value and       regional jet deliveries for a      billion value  Embraer claims crossover regional jets are more cost efficient than current turboprops beyond     nmi      km   routes that represented     of    seat turboprops flights in       This has led Wider e to deploy Embraer E Jet E s on longer routes  except for destinations with short runways and severe weather conditions north of the Arctic Circle  and AirBaltic to replace its fleet of    Dash   Q   s with Airbus    s     From      to       ATR forecasts       turboprop deliveries      with       seats and       with       seats      Hybrid aircraft edit  As legacy regional aircraft are used on very short sectors like connecting islands  their replacements could be hybrid or electric aircraft  Hybrid electric aircraft propulsion remains impeded by energy storage  high power electric distribution and the lack of certification framework  ATR Aircraft dismiss a fully electric propulsion as carrying the same payload over the same distances as an    t         lb  ATR     current batteries would weigh    t

low cost carrier  LCC  or low cost airline  also called a budget  or discount carrier or airline  is an airline that is operated with an emphasis on minimizing operating costs  It sacrifices certain traditional airline luxuries for cheaper fares  To make up for revenue lost in decreased ticket prices  the airline may charge extra fees  such as for carry on baggage  The term originated within the airline industry referring to airlines with a lower operating cost structure than their competitors  The term is often applied to any carrier with low ticket prices and limited services regardless of their operating models  Low cost carriers should not be confused with regional airlines that operate short haul flights without service  or with full service airlines offering some reduced fares  Some airlines advertise themselves as low cost while maintaining products usually associated with traditional mainline carriers  services  These products include preferred or assigned seating  catering  differentiated premium cabins  satellite or ground based Wi Fi internet  and in flight audio and video entertainment  The term ultra low cost carrier  ULCC  has been used  particularly in North America and Europe to refer to carriers that do not provide these services and amenities    Business model edit  A SunExpress Boeing         at Zurich Airport Southwest Airlines was formerly the world s largest low cost carrier  The low cost carrier business model practices vary widely  Some practices are more common in certain regions  while others are generally universal  The common theme among all low cost carriers is the reduction of cost and reduced overall fares compared to legacy carriers  Traditional airlines have also reduced their cost using several of these practices   Common practices edit  Aircraft edit  While some low cost carriers choose to operate more than one type of aircraft and configure their aircraft with more than one passenger class  most operate aircraft configured in a single class  as well as utilizing just a single aircraft type  In this way  cabin and ground crew only have to be trained to work on one type of aircraft  This is also beneficial from a maintenance standpoint as spare parts and mechanics will only be dedicated to one type of aircraft     These airlines tend to operate short haul flights that suit the range of narrow body  single aisle  planes  As of lately when    however  there is also a rise in demand for long range low cost flights and the availability of next generation planes that make long haul routes more feasible for LCCs     In the past  low cost carriers tended to operate older aircraft purchased second hand  such as the McDonnell Douglas DC   and older models of the Boeing      Since       fleets generally consist of the newest aircraft  commonly the Airbus A    family and Boeing      Although buying new aircraft is usually more expensive than second hand  new planes are cheaper to operate in the long run since they are extremely efficient in terms of fuel  training  maintenance  and crew costs per passenger  citation needed  In       ch aviation published a study about the fleet strategy of low cost carriers  citation needed  They stated that major LCCs that order aircraft in large numbers get large discounts for doing so  and due to this they can sell their aircraft just a few years after delivery at a price high enough to keep their operating costs relatively low     clarification needed  Aircraft often operate with a minimum set of equipment  further reducing costs of acquisition and maintenance  as well as keeping the weight of the aircraft lower and thus saving fuel  Depending on the low cost airline  seats do not recline and do not have rear pockets  to reduce cleaning and maintenance costs  Others have no window shades  Pilot conveniences  such as ACARS   may be excluded  Often  no in flight entertainment systems are made available  though many US low cost carriers do offer satellite television or radio in flight  It is also becoming a popular approach to install LCD monitors onto the aircraft and broadcast advertisements on them  coupled with the traditional route altitude speed information  Some allow priority boarding for an extra fee instead of reserved seating  and some allow reserving a seat in an emergency exit row  for longer leg room  at an extra cost   Bases edit  Like the major carriers  many low cost carriers develop one or more bases to maximize destination coverage and defend their market     Many do not operate traditional hubs  but rather focus cities   Simplicity edit  Passengers boarding a Spring Airlines aircraft via passenger boarding stairs at Shanghai Pudong International Airport Airlines often offer a simpler fare scheme  such as selling only one way tickets  Typically fares increase as the plane fills up  which rewards early reservations   In Europe  and early in Southwest s history  luggage is not transferred from one flight to another  even if both flights are with the same airline  This saves costs and is thought to encourage passengers to take direct flights  Tickets are not sold with transfers  so the airline can avoid responsibility for passengers  connections in the event of a delay  Low cost carriers often have a sparse schedule with one flight per day and route  so it would be hard to find an alternative for a missed connection  Modern US based low cost carriers generally transfer baggage for continuing flights  as well as transferring baggage to other airlines  Many airlines opt to have passengers board via stairs  since jetways generally cost more to lease  citation needed  Often  low cost carriers fly to smaller  less congested secondary airports and or fly to airports during off peak hours to avoid air traffic delays and take advantage of lower landing fees  This is why Ryanair flies to Gatwick Airport  Luton Airport  and Stansted Airport in the London area and how easyJet is able to fly to Paris Charles de Gaulle  and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol  In London s case however  low cost carriers would not be able to use Heathrow as the airport is running at near capacity  so there is no room to build a base  The airlines tend to offload  service and re load the aircraft  turnaround  in shorter time periods and do not wait for late passengers  allowing maximum utilization of aircraft   Many ULCC and LCC have very strict baggage policy  prompting a majority of passengers to buy extra luggage or to pay for a higher class priority  The addition of such  extra services  potentially costs the customer more than buying a full service ticket  Non flight revenue edit  Low cost carriers generate ancillary revenue from a variety of activities  such as   la carte features and commission based products  Some airlines may charge a fee for a pillow or blanket or for carry on baggage     In Europe  it is common for each and every convenience and service to have an additional charge    Limit personnel costs edit  Lion Air        ER in September       The aircraft has Boeing s livery on the fuselage and Lion Air s on the vertical stabilizer  This is one of the largest carriers and budget airlines in Southeast Asia  Low cost carriers intend to be low cost  so in many cases employees work multiple roles  At some airlines flight attendants also work as gate agents or assume other roles  thereby limiting personnel costs  Southwest Airlines is well known for using fuel hedging programs to reduce its overall fuel costs  Check in at the gate of luggage requires fees  as it requires addition to the weight calculation and last minute baggage handling  Online check in is becoming common  again in the interest of avoiding personnel costs  Where permissible  some airlines have a disinclination to handle Special Service passengers  for instance by placing a higher age limit on unaccompanied minors    than full service carriers  Often these airlines do not offer connecting tickets  since the airline will have to pay for ground crew to transfer luggage  A customer may create a connection manually by purchasing two separate tickets  but these are considered separate contracts  and the passenger bears the risk if a delayed inbound flight causes a missed connection     When most countries had national monopolies  crews could negotiate pay raises and good pension benefits  something that costs money for the airlines only in the long term   During this period  most passengers were business travellers who paid high fares that covered these costs  citation needed  After deregulation  which led to lower fares  many airlines remained bound to these salary agreements and pensions  whereas new low cost carriers employed new staff with lower salaries  especially for cabin crew  keeping personnel costs low and allowing for competitive fares  In some cases airlines have gone bankrupt  e g   Alitalia  Sabena  and Swissair   and new airlines replaced them  Traditional carriers followed the low cost carriers by enabling web check in  encouraging machine check in at the airport  and generally reducing ground personnel cost   The number of crew members follow international conventions that require one flight attendant per    passenger seats and two pilots  However  carriers can save money by reducing the amount of ground crew  Carriers hire pilots through third party agencies based in low tax countries without benefits for sick pay  pensions or health insurance     Traditional carriers have also started to try this  including starting their own low tax agencies     These agencies can easily find less experienced co pilots and cabin crew  as the profession is popular  but there are problems for low cost carriers to recruit and keep captains who have to be experienced      Principles of operation edit  A Gol Linhas A reas Inteligentes Boeing         at Afonso Pena International Airport At IATA  a LCC operation is defined as including the following characteristics  at least to some degree       Primarily point to point operations Short haul routes  often between regional or secondary airports Strong focus on price sensitive traffic  mostly leisure passengers Typically a single service class  with no  or limited  customer loyalty programmes Limited passenger services  with additional charges for some services  e g   on board catering  Low average fares  with a strong focus on price competition Different fares offered  related to aircraft load factors and length of time before departure A very high proportion of bookings made through the Internet High aircraft utilisation rates  with short turnaround between operations A fleet of just one or two aircraft types Private sector companies A simple management and overhead structure with a lean strategic decision making process While low cost airlines differ in service offerings  by definition they feature most of the following   Standardized fleet  which lowers the cost of training and maintenance  Absent non essential features  reclining seats  frequent flyer programs  Use of secondary airports for lower landing fees and marketing support Avoidance of airports with high costs Rapid turnaround  less time on the ground  more flights per day  Fly at less desirable times  red eye flights  of the day  which price sensitive tourists accept Online ticket sales to avoid the cost of call centres or agents Online check in  fewer check in desks   charge for desk check in Baggage charges for checked bags to offset baggage handling and loading costs Use staff for multiple jobs  for example  check in desk agents loading bags or cabin crew checking tickets at the gate  Hedge fuel costs  buying fuel in advance when cheaper  Charge for all services  including on board services  reserved seating  and extra baggage  Do not use reserved seating  which slows down boarding   or charge extra for reserved seating or early boarding  Fly point to point  passenger transfers to other flights are not accommodated  no compensation for missed connections  Carry little extra fuel  reducing aircraft weight  Outfit plane with fuel saving modifications  such as winglets             Route planning before aircraft arrives at airport  saving time on the ground  Market destination services such as hotels and rental cars for commissions Cabin panels decorated with advertisements Differentiation edit  Not every low cost carrier implements all of the above points  For example  some try to differentiate themselves with allocated seating  while others operate more than one aircraft type  still others have relatively high operating costs but lower fares  JetBlue  for instance  has in flight entertainment in every passenger seat  Other airlines are limited on what points they can implement based on local laws  For example  Irish low cost airlines cannot remove window blinds from its aircraft  as they are required by the Irish Aviation Authority  As supply increases  this sort of differentiation by brand is an important criteria for the future success of low cost carriers  since many experts believe price competition alone is not enough  given the number of carriers      As the number of low cost carriers has grown  these airlines have begun to compete with one another in addition to the traditional carriers  In the US  airlines have responded by introducing variations to the model  In Europe  the emphasis has remained on reducing costs and no frills service       Ultra low cost carrier edit  A secondary term ultra low cost carrier  ULCC  has been used to differentiate some low cost airlines whose model deviates further from that of a standard low cost carrier  with ultra low cost carriers having minimal inclusions in the fare and a greater number of add on fees      In the US market  Allegiant Air      Avelo Airlines  Frontier Airlines      Spirit Airlines      and Sun Country Airlines         are considered to be ULCCs   In Europe  Ryanair and Wizz Air are the most prominent ULCCs  In Asia  Cebu Pacific and Super Air Jet are the most prominent ULCCs   Pricing policy edit  Further information

November        Learn how and when to remove this message  The pricing policy of the low cost carriers is usually very dynamic as befits their business model  with frequent discounts and tickets in promotion  Like other carriers  however  even if the advertised base prices are very low  charges and taxes are typically not mentioned  With some airlines  some flights are advertised as free  plus applicable taxes  fees and charges   Depending on the airline  perhaps as many  or as few  as ten percent of the seats on any flight are offered at the lowest price and are the first to sell  The prices steadily rise thereafter to a point where they can be comparable or more expensive than a flight on a full service carrier  Most airlines charge additional taxes and fees on their tickets  Some low cost airlines have been known to charge fees for the seemingly ridiculous  such as levying a credit card charge if credit card is the only payment method accepted   History edit  While tour and package operators have offered lower priced  lower frilled traveling for a large part of modern airline history  not until during the post Vietnam War era did this business model escalate  Through various ticket consolidators  charter airlines  and innovators in lower frills flying  such as Channel Airways and Court Line  the traveling public had been conditioned to want to travel to new and increasingly further away and exotic locations on vacation  rather than short haul trips to nearby beach resorts  citation needed  The world s first low cost airline was Pacific Southwest Airlines  which started intrastate flights connecting Southern and Northern California on   May       PSA s light hearted atmosphere and efficient operations were a runaway success early on  and inspired a number of low cost start ups across the United States  beginning in the mid     s  Herb Kelleher studied the success of PSA  and copied their culture closely when he established Southwest Airlines in       The first airline to offer cheaper transatlantic fares was Icelandic airline Loftlei ir in       often referred to as  the Hippie Airline   Many young Americans travelled to Europe after graduation  to experience the  old world culture   and they were more concerned with getting there cheaply than comfortably or even exactly on time  Loftlei ir was not famous for speed or punctuality  but flying with the company became a sort of rite of passage for those young  hippies   one of whom was Bill Clinton  later US President       Advert for Loftlei ir Icelandic Airlines on Fifth Avenue  New York in      The first airline offering no frills transatlantic service was Freddie Laker s Laker Airways  which operated its famous  Skytrain  service between London and New York City during the late     s  The service was suspended after Laker s competitors  British Airways and Pan Am  were able to price Skytrain out of the market      In the United States  airline carriers such as Midway Airlines and America West Airlines  which commenced operations after       soon realized a cost of available seat mile  CASM  advantage in relation to the traditional and established  legacy airlines such as Trans World Airlines and American Airlines  Often this CASM advantage has been attributed solely to the lower labor costs of the newly hired and lower pay grade workers of new start up carriers  such as ValuJet  Midway Airlines  and their like  However  these lower costs can also be attributed to the less complex aircraft fleets and route networks with which these new carriers began operations  in addition to their reduced labor costs  To combat the new round of low cost and start up entrants into the very competitive and deregulated United States airline industry  the mainline major carriers and network legacy carriers strategically developed no frills divisions within the main airlines brand and corporate structures  Among these were Continental Lite  Delta Express  MetroJet  Shuttle by United  Song  and Ted  However  most of these  airlines within an airline  were short lived and quickly disposed of when economic rationalization or competitive pressures subsided  citation needed  Taking a page clarification needed  from the mainline  major  or legacy carriers  desire to reduce costs in all ways possible in regards regional route networks by outsourcing regional operations to the lowest expense airline bidder capable of operating regional aircraft  a new generation of low cost airlines  in name only  soon evolved in the US with varying levels of success  Among these varieties of low cost and discount operators were noteworthy starts ups that managed to get off the ground by using the larger aircraft services of established charter airlines  Among this group were the virtual airlines  Direct Air  PeoplExpress  Western  and those that never began service such as JetAmerica  In Japan  low cost airlines made major inroads into the market in      when Peach  Jetstar Japan and AirAsia Japan began operations  each with financial sponsorship by a domestic legacy airline and one or more foreign investors  By mid       these new LCCs were operating at a unit cost of around   yen per seat kilometer  compared to       yen per seat kilometer for domestic legacy airlines  However  their unit cost was still much higher than the   yen per seat kilometer for AirAsia in Malaysia  due to the higher cost of landing fees and personnel in Japan      In     s and     s  the low cost airline sector  once a relatively minor segment of the aviation industry  has expanded significantly and is projected to continue growing  The market is expected to increase from an estimated value of USD       billion to USD       billion by

 starting with Christchurch  New Zealand  In late       others followed from Sydney  Melbourne and Brisbane  to popular tourist destinations within    hours like Honolulu  Japan  Vietnam  Thailand and Malaysia  With new aircraft deliveries  it hopes to fly to the continental US and Europe  In April       the industry magazine Airline Business analysed the potential for low cost long haul service and concluded that a number of Asian carriers  including AirAsia  were closest to making such a model work      On    October       Oasis Hong Kong Airlines started flying from Hong Kong Airport to London Gatwick  The lowest prices for flights between Hong Kong to London could be as low at      approximately US      per leg  not including taxes and other charges  for economy class and       approximately US      per leg for business class for the same route  From    June       a second long haul route to Vancouver  British Columbia  was started  The company ceased operations on   April       after over a billion Hong Kong dollars in losses  On   November       AirAsia X  a subsidiary of AirAsia and Virgin Group flew its inaugural flight from Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  to Gold Coast

transatlantic flights market with         seats offered over    city pairs in September       a     growth over one year   compared to         seats over    pairs for Leisure airlines and           seats over     pairs for mainline carriers      Former American Airlines CEO Bob Crandall thinks the legacy carriers will force Long haul LCCS to lose too much money and will continue to dominate      While Asian carriers like AirAsia X  Scoot  Cebu Pacific and Jetstar Airways are successful  the October      demise of Primera Air and its     transatlantic flights illustrates the difficulties of the model  as the US World Airways will be relaunched in           Norse Atlantic Airways was founded in      and commenced operations in       operating transatlantic flights as well as flights to Thailand beginning in       In June       HiSky started long haul operations between Bucharest Otopeni to New York JFK   Low cost business only carriers edit  A trend from the mid     s was the formation of new low cost carriers exclusively targeting the long haul business market  Aircraft are generally configured for a single class of service  initially on transatlantic routings  Similarly  Midwest Express  later Midwest Airlines  which operated from      until it was absorbed into Frontier Airlines in       and Legend Airlines which ceased operations in late      were also founded on this operating model  Probably best described as  fewer frills  rather than  no frills   the initial entrants in this market utilized second hand  mid sized  twin jets  such as Boeing     and Boeing      in an attempt to service the lucrative London US Eastern Seaboard market   Eos Airlines  which ceased operating on    April          MAXjet  which ceased its scheduled business flights in December      and was unable to transition to charter as planned          Silverjet  which ceased operations on    May           La Compagnie Criticism edit  Some elements of the low cost model have been subject to criticism by governments and regulators  and in the UK in particular  the issue of  unbundling  of ancillary charges by both low cost carriers and other airlines  showing airport fees or taxes as separate charges rather than as part of the advertised fare  to make the  headline fare  appear lower has resulted in enforcement action      Considering that this amounts to a misleading approach to pricing  the United Kingdom s Office of Fair Trading  OFT  in February      gave all carriers and travel companies three months to include all fixed non optional costs in their basic advertised prices  Although the full service carriers had complied within the specified timescales  the low cost carriers have been less compliant in this respect  leading to the prospect of legal action by the OFT      Some destination cities lie relatively far from the airports that low cost airlines use to save costs  Examples of this are Hahn  Weeze and Girona airports which low cost airlines advertise as the destinations for Frankfurt  D sseldorf  and Barcelona  respectively even though these airports are    to    kilometres away  This has drawn criticism  mostly from competing airlines that fly closer to the destinations      IAG CEO Willie Walsh found established airlines arrogant facing the LCC model  For instance  Aer Lingus turned down the opportunity to buy Ryanair for     million Irish pounds        million   The company further stated that it would not have developed Ryanair and instead would have shut it down           See also edit  Low cost carrier terminal

     From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia   Airport that an airline uses as a transfer point to get passengers to their intended destination See also  List of hub airports   Passengers flying on Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners may connect through Frankfurt Airport  Lufthansa s main hub An airline hub or hub airport is an airport used by one or more airlines to concentrate passenger traffic and flight operations  Hubs serve as transfer  or stop over  points to help get passengers to their final destination  a  b  It is part of the hub and spoke system  An airline may operate flights from several non hub  spoke  cities to the hub airport  and passengers traveling between spoke cities connect through the hub  This paradigm creates economies of scale that allow an airline to serve  via an intermediate connection  city pairs that could otherwise not be economically served on a non stop basis  This system contrasts with the point to point model  in which there are no hubs and nonstop flights are instead offered between spoke cities  Hub airports also serve origin and destination  O D  traffic    Operations edit  The primary hub of British Airways is Heathrow Airport in London The hub and spoke system allows an airline to serve fewer routes  so fewer aircraft are needed     The system also increases passenger loads  a flight from a hub to a spoke carries not just passengers originating at the hub  but also passengers originating at multiple spoke cities     However  the system is costly  Additional employees and facilities are needed to cater to connecting passengers  To serve spoke cities of varying populations and demand  an airline requires several aircraft types  and specific training and equipment are necessary for each type     In addition  airlines may experience capacity constraints as they expand at their hub airports        For the passenger  the hub and spoke system offers one stop air service to a wide array of destinations        However  it requires having to regularly make connections en route to their final destination  which increases travel time     Additionally  airlines can come to monopolise their hubs  fortress hubs   allowing them to freely increase fares as passengers have no alternative     High domestic connectivity in the United States is achieved through airport location and hub dominance  The top    megahubs in the US are dominated by American Airlines  Delta Air Lines and United Airlines  three of the four largest United States based airlines      Banking edit  Airlines may operate banks of flights at their hubs  in which several flights arrive and depart within short periods of time  The banks may be known as  peaks  of activity at the hubs and the non banks as  valleys   Banking allows for short connection times for passengers     However  an airline must assemble many resources to cater to the influx of flights during a bank  and having several aircraft on the ground at the same time can lead to congestion and delays     In addition  banking could result in inefficient aircraft utilisation  with aircraft waiting at spoke cities for the next bank         Instead  some airlines have debanked their hubs  introducing a  rolling hub  in which flight arrivals and departures are spread throughout the day  This phenomenon is also known as  depeaking       While costs may decrease  connection times are longer at a rolling hub     American Airlines was the first to depeak its hubs     trying to improve profitability following the September    attacks     It rebanked its hubs in       however  feeling the gain in connecting passengers would outweigh the rise in costs     For example  the hub of Qatar Airways in Doha Airport has     daily movements to     destinations by March      with an average of     seats per movement  in three main waves                   movements                     and                    allowing around    million connecting passengers in            History edit  United States edit  Before the US airline industry was deregulated in       most airlines operated under the point to point system  with a notable exception being Pan Am      The Civil Aeronautics Board dictated which routes an airline could fly  At the same time  however  some airlines began to experiment with the hub and spoke system  Delta Air Lines was the first to implement such a system  providing service to remote spoke cities from its Atlanta hub     After deregulation  many airlines quickly established hub and spoke route networks of their own       US major top

Airport In       the governments of Bahrain  Oman  Qatar and the United Arab Emirates took control of Gulf Air from the British Overseas Airways Corporation  BOAC   Gulf Air became the flag carrier of the four Middle Eastern nations  It linked Oman  Qatar and the UAE to its Bahrain hub  from which it offered flights to destinations throughout Europe and Asia  In the UAE  Gulf Air focused on Abu Dhabi rather than Dubai  contrary to the aspirations of UAE Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to transform the latter into a world class metropolis  Sheikh Mohammed proceeded to establish a new airline based in Dubai  Emirates  which launched operations in           Elsewhere in the Middle East region  Qatar and Oman decided to create their own airlines as well  Qatar Airways and Oman Air were both founded in       with hubs at Doha and Muscat respectively  As the new airlines grew  their home nations relied less on Gulf Air to provide air service  Qatar withdrew its share in Gulf Air in       In       the UAE formed another national airline  Etihad Airways  which is based in Abu Dhabi  The country exited Gulf Air in       and Oman followed in           Gulf Air therefore became fully owned by the government of Bahrain  Emirates  Qatar Airways  Saudia and Etihad Airways have since established large hubs at their respective home airports  The hubs  which benefit from their proximity to large population centres      have become popular stopover points on trips between Europe and Asia  for example      Their rapid growth has impacted the development of traditional hubs  such as London Heathrow  Paris Charles de Gaulle  and New York JFK       Types of hubs edit  FedEx Express aircraft at Memphis International Airport Cargo hubs and scissor hubs edit  A cargo hub is an airport that primarily is operated by a cargo airline that uses the hub and spoke system  In the United States  two of the largest cargo hub airports  FedEx s Memphis Superhub and UPS Louisville Worldport  are close to the mean center of the United States population  FedEx s airline  FedEx Express  established its Memphis hub in       prior to the deregulation of the air cargo industry in the United States  The system has created an efficient delivery system for the airline      UPS Airlines has followed a similar pattern in Louisville  In Europe  ASL Airlines  Cargolux and DHL Aviation follow a similar strategy and operate their primary hubs at Li ge  Luxembourg and Leipzig respectively      Additionally  Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage  Alaska  is a frequent stop over hub for many cargo airlines flying between Asia and North America  Most cargo airlines only stop in Anchorage for refueling and customs  but FedEx and UPS frequently use Anchorage to sort trans pacific packages between regional hubs on each continent in addition to refueling and customs      Passenger airlines that operate in a similar manner to the FedEx and UPS hubs are often regarded as scissor hubs  as many flights to one destination all land and deplane passengers simultaneously and  after a passenger transit period  repeat a similar process for departure to the final destination of each plane      In past  Air India operated a scissor hub at London s Heathrow Airport  where passengers from Delhi  Ahmedabad  and Mumbai could continue onto a flight to Newark      Until its grounding  Jet Airways operated a similar scissor hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol to transport passengers from Bangalore  Mumbai and Delhi to Toronto Pearson and vice versa  At the peak of operations at their former scissor hub at Brussels prior to the      shift to Schiphol  flights operated from Mumbai  Delhi  and Chennai and continued onward to Toronto  New York  and Newark after a near simultaneous stopover in Brussels and vice versa      An international scissor hub could be used for third and fourth freedom flights or it could be used for fifth freedom flights  for which a precursor is a bilateral treaty between two country pairs  WestJet used to utilize St  John s as a scissor hub during its summer schedule for flights inbound from Ottawa  Toronto  and Orlando and outbound to Dublin and London Gatwick  Qantas similarly used to utilize Los Angeles International Airport as a scissor hub for flights inbound from Melbourne  Brisbane or Sydney  where passengers could connect onwards if traveling to New York JFK   Focus city edit  The focus cities of JetBlue are Boston  Fort Lauderdale  Los Angeles  New York JFK  Orlando  and San Juan      In the airline industry  a focus city is a destination from which an airline operates limited point to point routes      A focus city primarily caters to the local market rather than to connecting passengers          Although the term focus city is used to mainly refer to an airport from which an airline operates limited point to point routes  its usage has loosely expanded to refer to a small scale hub as well      For example  even though JetBlue s operations at New York JFK resemble that of a hub  the airline still refers to it as a focus city      Fortress hub edit  A fortress hub refers to an airport where a single airline dominates the market share  making it challenging for competitors to establish a foothold      This term is commonly used in the United States  where the airlines with the largest fortress hubs are Delta Air Lines at Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport and American Airlines at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport  Most national flag carriers maintain a similarly dominant presence at their countries  primary international airport  benefiting from historical advantages and market influence  Examples include   Aegean Airlines in Athens Aeromexico in Mexico City Air Canada at Toronto Pearson Air France at Paris Charles de Gaulle Avianca at El Dorado International Airport in Bogot   D C  British Airways at London Heathrow Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong China Airlines at Taipei Taoyuan Copa Airlines in Panama City Emirates in Dubai Ethiopian Airlines in Addis Ababa Finnair in Helsinki Iberia in Madrid Japan Airlines at Tokyo Haneda Iran Air at Tehran Imam Khomeini ITA Airways in Rome Aeroflot at Moscow Sheremetyevo Korean Air at Seoul Incheon KLM in Amsterdam LOT in Warsaw Lufthansa in Frankfurt Malaysia Airlines at Kuala Lumpur International Qantas in Sydney Qatar Airways in Doha Singapore Airlines in Singapore South African Airways in Johannesburg Swiss International Air Lines in Zurich TAP Air Portugal in Lisbon Turkish Airlines in Istanbul Primary and secondary hubs edit  A primary hub is the main hub for an airline  However  as an airline expands operations at its primary hub to the point that it experiences capacity limitations  it may elect to open secondary hubs  Examples of such hubs are Air Canada s hubs at Montr al Trudeau and Vancouver  British Airways  hub at London Gatwick  Air India s hub at Mumbai and Lufthansa s hub at Munich  By operating multiple hubs  airlines can expand their geographic reach      They can also better serve spoke spoke markets  providing more itineraries with connections at different hubs     Cargo airlines like FedEx Express and UPS Airlines also operate secondary hubs to an extent  but these are primarily used to serve regional high demand destinations because shipping packages through its main hub would waste fuel  an example of this would be FedEx transiting a package through Oakland International Airport when shipping packages between destinations near Seattle and Phoenix  Arizona instead of sending deliveries through the Memphis Superhub       Reliever hub edit  A given hub s capacity may become exhausted or capacity shortages may occur during peak periods of the day  at which point airlines may be compelled to shift traffic to a reliever hub  A reliever hub has the potential to serve several functions for an airline  it can bypass the congested hub  it can absorb excess demand for flights that could otherwise not be scheduled at the congested hub  and it can schedule new O D city pairs for connecting traffic  One of the most recognized examples of this model is Delta Air Lines  and American Airlines  uses of LaGuardia Airport as a domestic hub in New York City  due to capacity and slot restrictions at their hubs at John F  Kennedy International Airport  Many regional flights operate out of LaGuardia  while most international and long haul domestic flights remain at JFK  Lufthansa operates a similar model of business with its hubs at Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport  Generally speaking  a marginal majority of the airline s long haul flights are based out of Frankfurt  while a similarly sized but smaller minority are based out of Munich   Moonlight hub edit  In past history  carriers have maintained niche  time of day operations at hubs  The most notable was America West s use of Las Vegas as a primary night flight hub to increase aircraft utilization rates far beyond those of competing carriers   See also edit  Hidden city ticketing List of former airline hubs List of hub airports Point to point transit Transport hub Notes edit      Colloquially  an airline hub may be defined as an airport that receives many passengers or as an airport that serves as the operating base of an airline  whether or not the airline allows for connecting traffic        The Federal Aviation Administration of the United States defines a hub in terms of passenger enplanements  Specifically  a hub is an airport that handles       or more of the nation s annual passenger boardings           Alaska Airlines             References edit      a b c Holloway  Stephen         Straight and Level  Practical

article is about the airline practice  For the sewing term  see Interfacing  For the convention of interlined email replies  see posting style  This article relies largely or entirely on a single

scholar   JSTOR  September          Look up interlining in Wiktionary  the free dictionary   Interlining  also known as interline ticketing and interline booking  is a voluntary commercial agreement between individual airlines to handle passengers traveling on itineraries that require multiple flights on multiple airlines     Such agreements allow passengers to change from one flight on one airline to another flight on another airline without having to gather their bags or check in again  Airlines can also promise free rebooking if the connection is lost due to a delay  Interlining agreements differ from codeshare agreements in that codeshare agreements usually refers to numbering a flight with the airline s code  abbreviation  even though the flight is operated by another airline   However  codeshare relationships can affect whether an interline ticket  or e ticket  can be issued  since both the codeshare marketing carrier and codeshare operating carrier must have interline agreements with all other carriers in the itinerary to allow a single ticket to be issued  Interline agreements are directional   For example  it may be possible for American Airlines to issue the ticket on an American United itinerary  but United might not be able to be the issuer on the same itinerary  Such a one directional interline agreement is called a unilateral interline  The airlines may also agree to enter a bilateral interline agreement  where each airline can issue the ticket on the other airline  Previously  only large network carriers such as United Airlines and Lufthansa would have electronic ticket interline agreements  but the IATA mandate to eliminate paper tickets at the end of      has changed this by forcing smaller carriers to implement electronic ticketing  Smaller legacy carriers commonly have interline agreements with large network carriers that fly into their markets   Most newer low cost airlines that only sell directly to consumers  and not through agencies or Global distribution systems  do not support interlining at all  If no interline ticketing agreement exists  then two separate tickets will need to be issued  and passengers will have to retrieve their bags and carry it to the connecting airline for check in  Itineraries with interline connections such as this are riskier for travelers  since the second carrier may be unaware of delays or issues with the incoming flight and is less likely to permit a rebooking without cost if the connection is lost  Yield management usually makes purchase of new short notice tickets in the event of a lost connection expensive  There can also be a problem if luggage is lost and the traveler wants it to be sent to them later  Most online travel agencies will only display itineraries that can be ticketed on one of their booking systems   However  some ticket websites will sometimes display un ticketable interline itineraries   Examples could be found previously on routes to Mexico involving the now defunct Aero California  or may be currently found on routes to Indonesia involving Lion Air  These are often displayed as  contact airline to buy    Participating airlines edit  Carriers that participate in airline alliances such as Star Alliance  SkyTeam or oneworld almost always have interline agreements with one another  However  even direct competitors can benefit from interline agreements   When a ticket is issued for an interline itinerary  one of the airlines in that itinerary will be selected by the ticketing agent as the issuing airline  commonly referred to as the  plating carrier   The plating carrier collects the entire fare from the customer  either via own sales channels  e g   web site or ticket office   or via travel agents  Travel agents remit collected fares and taxes to the plating carrier via Airlines Reporting Corporation  ARC  in the US  or Billing and Settlement Plan  BSP  in the rest of the world  The airline which actually carried the passenger  the operating airline  will send an invoice to the issuing plating carrier  normally via IATA Clearing House  to collect its portion of the fare and taxes  The operating airline is responsible for remitting passenger taxes to the various governments and airports  Some taxes are sales based  US taxes   and are remitted by the issuing airline  Only the issuing carrier is responsible for paying commission to the agency  The amount of commission is based on the entire air fare  but the percentage amount varies from the amount paid if only a single airline was involved  Normal fare construction rules state that an international ticket issued should be issued by the first international carrier  There are some exceptions  such as if the first international is a codeshare flight  when the first non codeshare would be used  or if an airline does not have an office in the country of origin  Ferry and bus companies  such as TurboJET  can also participate in interlining by getting an IATA code for the operator and for the destinations they travel to  and produce schedules for their services  Railway operators also participate in interlining with airlines  For example  ITA Airways maintains agreements with the Spanish Iryo and the Italian Trenitalia      Virtual interlining edit  During the     s  companies like Dohop  which collaborates with EasyJet  and the Czech travel agency Kiwi began to sell interlining tickets  They purchase single segments on booking systems like Sabre and Amadeus  and re package them with additional services  like reimbursed hotel costs in case of missed connections  vouchers to purchase another connecting flight  and phone helplines  In case of virtual interlining  passengers have to re claim and re check their baggage  and they are not allowed to use the customs free transit area  as they are travelling on a string of single flights  not two  or more  connecting flights  Thus  virtual interlining is easier within a visa free area  like the United States and Canada  or within Europe s Schengen area   References edit      Todd  Ginger  Rice  Susan  July        Travel Perspectives  A Guide to

information display showing code shared flights  indicated by multiple flight numbers at identical times and gate numbers   at Warsaw Chopin Airport  An information display showing code shared flights  indicated by multiple flight numbers in a single time slot   at Fukuoka Airport  A codeshare agreement  also known simply as codeshare  is a business arrangement  common in the aviation industry  in which two or more airlines publish and market the same flight under their own airline designator and flight number  the  airline flight code   as part of their published timetable or schedule  Typically  a flight is operated by one airline  technically called an  administrating carrier     or  operating carrier   while seats are sold for the flight by all cooperating airlines using their own designator and flight number  The term  code  refers to the identifier used in a flight schedule  generally the two character IATA airline designator code and flight number  Thus  XX     flight number     operated by the airline XX   might also be sold by airline YY as YY    and by ZZ as ZZ      Airlines YY and ZZ are in this case called  marketing airlines   sometimes abbreviated MKT CXR for  marketing carrier    Most of the major airlines today have code sharing partnerships with other airlines  and code sharing is a key feature of the major airline alliances  Typically  code sharing agreements are also part of the commercial agreements between airlines in the same airline alliances    History edit  In       Richard A  Henson s Hagerstown Commuter airline joined with US Airways predecessor  regional Allegheny Airlines  in the nation s first codeshare relationship     The term  code sharing  or  codeshare  was coined in      by Qantas and American Airlines     and in      the two firms provided their first codeshare flights between an array of Australian and U S  cities  Code sharing has become widespread in the airline industry since then  particularly in the wake of the formation of large airline alliances  These alliances have extensive codesharing and networked frequent flyer programs   Terminology edit  Under a code sharing agreement  the airline that administers the flight  the one holding the operational permissions  airport slots and planning controlling the flight and responsible for the ground handling services  is commonly called the operating carrier  often abbreviated OPE CXR  even though the IATA SSIM term  administrating carrier  is  more precise  The reason for this is that a third carrier may be involved  typically in the case that the airline originally planning to operate the flight needs to hire a subcontractor to operate the flight on their behalf  typically a wet lease  meaning an aircraft is leased with crew and all facilities to fly  commonly due to capacity limitations  technical problems etc   In this case  the airline  carrying the passenger should be designated the operating carrier  since it is the one carrying the passengers cargo  citation needed  When a flight is sold under several designators and flight numbers as described above  the one published by the  administrating carrier  is commonly called a  prime flight   as opposed to a codeshare marketing flight   citation needed   Reasons and advantages edit  Under a code sharing agreement  participating airlines can present a common flight number for several reasons  including   For passengers edit  Connecting flights  This provides clearer routing for the customer  allowing a customer to book travel from point A to C through point B under one carrier s code  instead of a customer booking from point A to B under one code  and from point B to C under another code  This is not only a superficial addition as cooperating airlines also strive to synchronize their schedules  For airlines edit  Flights from both airlines that fly the same route  this provides an apparent increase in the frequency of service on the route by one airline  Perceived service to non serviced markets  this provides a method for carriers who do not operate their own aircraft on a given route to gain exposure in the market through display of their flight numbers  Types of code

A commercial  marketing  airline purchases a fixed number of seats from the administrating  operating prime  carrier  A fixed price is typically paid  and the seats are kept away from the administrating carrier s inventory  The marketing airline decides on its own which booking classes the seats are sold in  the block of seats are optimized just like another aircraft cabin   Free flow

disambiguation     United MileagePlus cards A frequent flyer programme  FFP  is a loyalty program offered by an airline  Many airlines have frequent flyer programmes designed to encourage airline customers enrolled in the programme to accumulate points  also called miles  kilometres  or segments  which may then be redeemed for air travel or other rewards  Points earned under FFPs may be based on the class of fare  distance flown on that airline or its partners  or the amount paid  There are other ways to earn points  For example  in recent years  more points have been earned by using co branded credit and debit cards than by air travel  Another way to earn points is spending money at associated retail outlets  car hire companies  hotels  or other associated businesses  Points can be redeemed for air travel  other goods or services  or for increased benefits  such as travel class upgrades  airport lounge access  fast track access  or priority bookings  Frequent flyer programs can be seen as a certain type of virtual currency  one with unidirectional flow of money to purchase points  but no exchange back into money        FFPs have become an important part of airlines  economic models  with for example United and Delta both able to earn more than    billion in      because of their FFP       History edit  Although United Airlines had tracked customers as far back as the     s  the first modern frequent flyer programme was created in      by Western Direct Marketing for United  It gave plaques and promotional materials to members  In       Texas International Airlines created the first frequent flyer programme that used mileage tracking to give  rewards  to its passengers  while in      Western Airlines created its Travel Bank  which ultimately became part of Delta Air Lines  programme upon their merger in             American Airlines  AAdvantage programme launched in      as a modification of a never realized concept from      that would have given special fares to frequent customers     It was quickly followed later that year by programs from United Airlines  Mileage Plus   Delta  Delta Air Lines Frequent Flyer Program  which later changed to SkyMiles   Continental Airlines  OnePass   Air Canada  Aeroplan   and in      from British Airways  Executive Club      Frequent flyer programs have grown since  In           million people were enrolled in frequent flyer programs from over     airlines     By then     trillion frequent flyer points had been accumulated by people worldwide  for a value of     billion US dollars     When United Airlines filed for bankruptcy in       its frequent flyer programme was its only money making business     Tom Stuker is the world s most frequent flier having logged over    million miles with United      Accrual edit  Frequent flyer programme rules can be complex  this      pamphlet from TWA s program ran to    pages Flying edit  Main article  List of frequent flyer programs Most larger airlines around the world have frequent flyer programs  each has a programme name  and policies and restrictions regarding joining  accumulating  and redeeming points  The primary method of obtaining points in a frequent flyer programme until recent years was to fly with the associated airline     Paying expenses using an airline sponsored credit card  even those charged to an employer  can rack up frequent flyer points     Most systems reward travellers with a specific number of points based on the distance travelled  such as   point per mile flown   although systems vary  Many discount airlines  rather than awarding points per mile  award points for flight segments in lieu of distance or the amount paid  For example  a number of airlines in Europe offer a fixed number of points for domestic or intra European flights regardless of the distance  but varied according to class of travel      With the introduction of airline alliances and code share flights  frequent flyer programs are often extended to allow benefits to be used across partner airlines       Bonus points edit  Further information  Fare basis code Most  if not all  programmes award bonus earnings to premium cabin passengers and to their elite status members based on tier status  earning an extra          of miles flown are common bonuses  While these bonus points may not count toward ascension to  or retention of  elite status  they count toward the member s total balance for normal redemption purposes   Minimum credit guarantee edit  Some programs award a full     points  or a similar minimum credit guarantee  for non stop flights spanning less than     miles  An airline s programme can either award this guarantee to all members regardless of elite status      or they can reserve this privilege only for their elite members       Credit card purchases edit  Many credit card companies partner with airlines to offer a co branded credit card or the ability to transfer points in their loyalty programme to an airline s programme  Large sign up bonuses and other incentives are common  Accruing points via credit cards bonuses and spending allows infrequent travellers to benefit from the frequent flyer programme  With a non affiliated travel rewards credit card a cardmember can buy a positive space ticket considered  revenue  class  which can earn the passenger points with the airline flown       Other purchases edit  Frequent flyer programs may offer points through other means  such as purchasing food or merchandise sold by an affiliated company  American engineer David Phillips gained attention in      for purchasing        of Healthy Choice pudding to earn him           AAdvantage miles       Elite status edit  Occasionally  airlines may offer double elite qualifying mile  EQM  promotions  which speeds up a member s status ascension  or retention  by reducing flight mileage requirements      Some carriers also require frequent flyers to spend a set amount of money on tickets before they are eligible for elite status  This is in addition to the miles flown requirements that are already in place  Delta switched to revenue based elite status requirements in January       United in March       with American Airlines the last of the three US legacy carriers to switch on August                      This has led to some frequent flyers devaluing those programs over others  as the changing model can be less rewarding to frequent flyers      To date no UK frequent flyer scheme has sought to operate in such a fashion  with both Virgin Atlantic and British Airways opting for the traditional method of granting tier points based on the miles flown and class of travel       Redemption edit  After accumulating a certain number of points  members then use these points to obtain airline tickets  However  points only pay for the base fare  with the member still responsible for the payment of mandatory taxes and fees  citation needed   Flights edit  Although a controversial topic and a source of frustration among frequent flyers      award flights are still the primary commodity purchased by members using points  While alliances and partnerships have facilitated the redemption process for some programs  award seat availability is still subject to blackout dates and seasonal fluctuations  as airlines utilize statistics  yield management  and capacity control formulas to determine the number of seats to allocate for award booking      This lack of availability has since been alleviated by non airline rewards programs  such as certain credit cards  see above  and other corporate programs  Expedia Rewards  Marriott        by allowing a member to use points to search for and purchase revenue tickets as if using cash  independent source needed   Products and services edit  Depending on an airline s programme  members can also redeem points toward cabin upgrades  hotel stays  car rentals  and purchase of various retail items  On American Airlines  AAdvantage program for example  it is possible to pay for a complete vacation package solely with points       Value of points edit  The value of frequent flyer points varies depending on how they are redeemed  When used for economy class travel based on discounted fares  the estimated value is typically between one and two cents per point      A      economics PhD thesis from Monash University analyzed the cash equivalent value of loyalty points  the influence of frequent flyer programs  FFPs  on consumer behavior  and related taxation issues  Unlike much previous research  this study used data from an actual FFP  It found that in       the estimated cash value of a point ranged from AU        to AU         excluding the value of status related benefits  Points earned per flight represented a discount on airfare of approximately      for low status members        for mid tier members  and       for high status members      A survey of over       members of the program indicated that many leisure and business travelers were willing to pay more to fly with the airline due to their FFP membership  This willingness to pay  known as the FFP premium  averaged around     with differences observed between traveler types  Based on this premium  the estimated point value ranged from AU        to AU         depending on membership status  Airlines typically assign a much lower value to points in their financial statements  reportedly less than one one thousandth of a cent per point  citation needed  However  the monetary value of points is also reflected in the ability of some programs to donate points to charitable organizations       Accounting and regulatory issues edit  The frequent flyer points accumulated through business trips are a desirable employee benefit  which can encourage unnecessary travel within organisations to accumulate them and lead to superfluous personal trips      Business travellers typically accrue the valuable points in their own names  rather than the names of the companies that paid for the travel  This has raised concerns that the company is providing a tax free benefit  point based awards  to employees      or that employees have misappropriated value that belongs to the company  or even that the rewards acts as a kind of bribe to encourage travellers to choose one particular airline or travel unnecessarily  Most companies consider the miles earned by their employees to be a valuable personal perk that in part compensates for the daily grind of frequent business travel  though some governmental organizations have attempted to prevent their employees from accumulating miles on official travel      Although it has long been recognised that FFP rewards earned on employer funded business flights should be subject to either income or fringe benefit taxation  this is currently not taking place in the vast majority of countries   a notable exception however being Germany      One of the main arguments against the implementation of taxation is the lack of a monetary tax base  It can however be argued that since the cash equivalent value of loyalty currency can be reasonably estimated with public data  this value is appropriate as a tax base  Hurdles preventing the taxation of FFP rewards are generally less related to the technical issue of valuation  but have more to do with legal constraints  e g   who owns the points   and often a lack of political will  e g   who would lose out due to taxation        Australian and German public servants are not permitted to redeem points accrued from official travel for private purposes      The Australian example occurred in the     s when Qantas and the now defunct Ansett Australia competed for the Australian federal government travel contract  this was put forward as a system requirement for the competing companies in order to win the contract  citation needed  In the US  the General Services Administration has regulated   frequent traveler benefits earned  by federal employees  in connection with official travel   which  may be used only for official travel  see    C F R            f        Frequent flyer programme contracts are not generally regulated       Competition edit  These programmes have been studied as anti competitive practices  in       M  Tretheway found competition prevented an airline to unilaterally end its program  but the regulatory body could end all      in       S  Storm observed loyalty programs were forbidden in Denmark until       instated then because Danish airlines were disadvantaged  as governments can forbid these programs at industry players request and the World Trade Organization could ban all programs      page range too broad  In the U S  in       Braniff wished for an end to unfair competition from frequent flyer programs      Precedent exists for ending frequent flyer programs  In       Norway banned domestic loyalty programs to promote airline competition      In       the Modernization Minister asked the competition authority to consider extending the Norwegian ban on frequent flyer miles to include all of Scandinavia          The country lifted the ban in      when the competitive situation changed       Flight shame edit  Main article  Flight shame Frequent flyer programs have been receiving scrutiny because of the prevalence and rapid growth of air travel  in terms of both the frequency that individuals fly and the tendency toward longer distance travel  In       S  Cohen observed both air travel and concern over its climate impacts were growing  balanced by technology and physical resources  self and external regulation and social norms including stigmatisation of excessive air travel      In       Stefan G ssling pointed out the conflict caused by air travel growth in a carbon constrained world  with a minority of hypermobile individuals responsible for a large share of air travel       Mileage runs edit  A  mileage run  is an airline trip designed and taken solely to gain maximum frequent flyer miles  points  or elite status usually at lowest cost      If a traveler  or traveller  has already achieved some sort of elite status  then that traveler will earn bonus award miles or points on top of their actual flight miles or points  Depending on the program  that traveler will reach their goal sooner if the miles they accrue are elite qualifying miles      A mileage run may allow a traveler to  re  qualify for a beneficial elite level  which requires a minimum number of miles to qualify      Some airlines have changed their frequent flyer rules to award miles based on ticket expense rather than absolute distance traveled  which may remove the incentive for mileage runs       Status challenge edit  A status challenge     can be an often non publicized offer to accrue a certain amount of flying within a certain very short timeframe  usually    days   to earn elite status  The higher status may or may not be given immediately if it can be seen that qualifying travel  particularly travel that is non refundable  has already been booked before the challenge was offered  otherwise higher status will be conferred once the challenge is officially completed  In some instances  a fee for a challenge may also be charged  citation needed  Status challenges are employed by other types of establishments  as well  such as casinos             and hotels  citation needed   Status match edit  Some airlines will match status             with that of a competitor upon application  usually to airlines outside of any alliance that the airline used to match status with belongs to  This enables travellers to switch their travel more easily from one carrier to another  e g   when the traveller s employer switches carriers due to a new travel contract s being signed   It does so by maintaining equivalent elite benefits with the new airline  without the need for time to pass while the traveller earns the benefits  this also has the side effect of retaining elite benefits with the previous airline  in order that one does not have to be given up for the other to allow for a more gradual transition  citation needed  Status matches are employed by other types of establishments  as well  such as casinos              cruise lines          hotels  citation needed  and rental car

enables transactions between travel industry service providers  mainly airlines  hotels  car rental companies  and travel agencies  The GDS mainly uses real time inventory  e g  number of hotel rooms available  number of flight seats available  or number of cars available  from the service providers  Travel agencies traditionally relied on GDS for services  products and rates in order to provide travel related services to the end consumers  Thus  a GDS can link services  rates and bookings consolidating products and services across all three travel sectors  i e   airline reservations  hotel reservations  car rentals  GDS is different from a computer reservation system  which is a reservation system used by the service providers  also known as vendors   Primary customers of GDS are travel agents  both online and office based  who make reservations on various reservation systems run by the vendors  GDS holds no inventory  the inventory is held on the vendor s reservation system itself  A GDS system will have a real time link to the vendor s database  For example  when a travel agency requests a reservation on the service of a particular airline company  the GDS system routes the request to the appropriate airline s computer reservations system    Example of a booking facilitation done by an airline GDS edit  A mirror image of the passenger name record  PNR  in the airline reservations system is maintained in the GDS system  If a passenger books an itinerary containing air segments of multiple airlines through a travel agency  the passenger name record in the GDS system would hold information on their entire itinerary  while each airline they fly on would only have a portion of the itinerary that is relevant to them  This would contain flight segments on their own services and inbound and onward connecting flights  known as info segments  of other airlines in the itinerary  For example  if a passenger books a journey from Amsterdam to London on KLM  London to New York on British Airways  and New York to Frankfurt on Lufthansa through a travel agent and if the travel agent is connected to Amadeus GDS  the PNR in the Amadeus GDS would contain the full itinerary  while the PNR in KLM would show the Amsterdam to London segment along with the British Airways flight as an onward info segment  Likewise  the PNR in the Lufthansa system would show the New York to Frankfurt segment with the British Airways flight as an arrival information segment  Finally  the PNR in British Airways  system would show all three segments  one as a live segment and the other two as arrival and onward info segments  Some GDS systems also have a dual use capability for hosting multiple computer reservation systems  in such situations functionally the computer reservations system and the GDS partition of the system behave as if they were separate systems  citation needed   Mid office travel automation edit  Mid office automation captures Passenger name record technically abbreviated as PNR data from a variety of global distribution systems  Sabre  Galileo  Amadeus  and Worldspan  sources and lets travel agencies create custom business rules to validate reservation accuracy  monitor travel policies  perform file finishing  prepare itineraries invoices and process ticketing  Quality control software is used for such functions as ensuring reservations are formatted properly  checking for lower fares and watching for seat availability  upgrades  waitlist clearance  and taking advantage of back to back ticketing opportunities  When customized  such tools allow agencies and corporate accounts to monitor virtually any information in global distribution system passenger name records  Accelerating such tools also creates opportunities for customer relationship management   a  Mid office automation is key to increasing the touchless rate of online adoption   Future of GDS systems and companies edit  Global distribution systems in the travel industry originated from a traditional legacy business model that existed to inter operate between airline vendors and travel agents  During the early days of computerized reservations systems flight ticket reservations were not possible without a GDS  As time progressed  many airline vendors  including budget and mainstream operators  have now adopted a strategy of  direct selling  to their wholesale and retail customers  passengers   They invested heavily in their own reservations and direct distribution channels and partner systems  This helps to minimize direct dependency on GDS systems to meet sales and revenue targets and allows for a more dynamic response to market needs  These technology advancements in this space facilitate an easier way to cross sell to partner airlines and via travel agents  eliminating the dependency on a dedicated global GDS federating between systems  Also  multiple price comparison websites eliminate the need of dedicated GDS for point in time prices and inventory for both travel agents and end customers  Hence some experts argued that these changes in business models might have led to the complete phasing out of GDS in the Airline space by the year          On the other hand  some travel professional experts demonstrate that GDS still continue to offer the flexibility and bulk buying capacities for airline consolidators to reach travel agents that individual airline systems are not able to provide customer segments with wider choices     Their argument is  individual airline distribution systems are not designed to interoperate with competitors systems  Lufthansa Group announced in June      that it was imposing an additional charge of     when booking through an external global distribution system rather than their own systems  They stated their choice was based upon that the costs of using external systems was several times higher than their own  Several other airlines including Air France KLM and Emirates Airline also stated that they are following the development           However  hotels and car rental industry continue to benefit from GDS  especially last minute inventory disposal using GDS to bring additional operational revenue  GDS here is useful to facilitate global reach using existing network and low marginal costs when compared to online air travel bookings  Some GDS companies are also in the process of investing and establishing significant offshore capability in a move to reduce costs and improve their profit margins to serve their customer directly

systems that allow an airline to sell their inventory  seats   It contains information on schedules and fares and contains a database of reservations  or passenger name records  and of tickets issued  if applicable   ARSs are part of passenger service systems  PSS   which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger  ARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system  CRS   A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a global distribution system  GDS  which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system    Overview edit  Airline reservation systems incorporate airline schedules  fare tariffs  passenger reservations and ticket records  An airline s direct distribution works within their own reservation system  as well as pushing out information to the GDS  The second type of direct distribution channel are consumers who use the internet or mobile applications to make their own reservations  Travel agencies and other indirect distribution channels access the same GDS as those accessed by the airline reservation systems  and all messaging is transmitted by a standardized messaging system that functions on two types of messaging that transmit on SITA s high level network  HLN   These messaging types are called Type A  usually EDIFACT format  for real time interactive communication and Type B  TTY  for informational and booking type of messages  Message construction standards set by IATA and ICAO  are global  and apply to more than air transportation  Since airline reservation systems are business critical applications  and they are functionally quite complex  the operation of an in house airline reservation system is relatively expensive  Prior to deregulation clarification needed   airlines owned their own reservation systems with travel agents subscribing to them  Today  the GDS are run by independent companies with airlines and travel agencies being major subscribers  As of February       there are only a few major GDS providers in the market  Amadeus  Travelport  which operates the Apollo  Worldspan and Galileo systems   Sabre  InteliSys Aviation  which owns ameliaRES PSS  and Shares  There is one major Regional GDS  Abacus  serving the Asian market and a number of regional players serving single countries  including Travelsky  China   ORS  Russia   Infini and Axess  both Japan  and Topas  South Korea    Of these  Infini is hosted within the Sabre complex  Axess is in the process of moving into a partition within the Worldspan complex  and Topas agencies will be migrating into Amadeus  Reservation systems may host  ticket less  airlines and  hybrid  airlines that use e ticketing in addition to ticket less to accommodate code shares and interlines  In addition to these  standardized  GDS  some airlines have proprietary versions which they use to run their flight operations  A few examples are Delta s OSS and Deltamatic systems and EDS SHARES   SITA Reservations remains the largest neutral multi host airline reservations system  with over     airlines currently managing inventory   Inventory management edit  In the airline industry  available seats are commonly referred to as inventory  The inventory of an airline is generally classified into service classes  e g  economy   premium economy  business or first class  and any number of fare classes  to which different prices and booking conditions may apply  Fare classes are complicated and vary from airline to airline  often indicated by a one letter code  The meaning of these codes are not often known by the passenger  but conveys information to airline staff  for example they may indicate that a ticket was fully paid  or discounted or purchased through a loyalty scheme  etc  Some seats may not be available for open sale  but reserved for example for connecting flight or loyalty scheme passengers  Overbooking is also a common practice  and is an exception to inventory management principles  One of the core functions of inventory management is inventory control  Inventory control monitors how many seats are available in the different fare classes  and by opening and closing individual fare classes for sale  A flight schedule management system forms the foundation of the inventory management system  Besides other functions  it is critical for ticket sales  crew member assignments  aircraft maintenance  airport coordination  and connections to partner airlines  The schedule system monitors what and when aircraft will be available on particular routes  and their internal configuration  Inventory data is imported and maintained from the schedule distribution system  Changes to aircraft availability would immediately impact the available seats of the fleet  as well as the seats which had been sold  The price for each sold seat is determined by a combination of the fares and booking conditions stored in the Fare Quote System   In most cases  inventory control has a real time interface to an airline s yield management system to support a permanent optimization of the offered booking classes in response to changes in demand or pricing strategies of competitors   Availability display and reservation  PNR  edit  Users access an airline s inventory through an availability display  It contains all offered flights for a particular city pair with their available seats in the different booking classes  This display contains flights which are operated by the airline itself as well as code share flights which are operated in co operation with another airline  If the city pair is not one on which the airline offers service  it may display a connection using its own flights or display the flights of other airlines  The availability of seats of other airlines is updated through standard industry interfaces  Depending on the type of co operation  it supports access to the last seat  last seat availability  in real time  Reservations for individual passengers or groups are stored in a so called passenger name record  PNR   Among other data  the PNR contains personal information such as name  contact information or special services requests  SSRs  e g  for a vegetarian meal  as well as the flights  segments  and issued tickets  Some reservation systems also allow to store customer data in profiles to avoid data re entry each time a new reservation is made for a known passenger  In addition  most systems have interfaces to CRM systems or customer loyalty applications  aka frequent traveler systems   Before a flight departs  the so called passenger name list  PNL  is handed over to the departure control system that is used to check in passengers and baggage  Reservation data such as the number of booked passengers and special service requests is also transferred to flight operations systems  crew management and catering systems  Once a flight has departed  the reservation system is updated with a list of the checked in passengers  e g  passengers who had a reservation but did not check in  no shows  and passengers who checked in  but did not have a reservation  go shows    Finally  data needed for revenue accounting and reporting is handed over to administrative systems   Fare quote and ticketing edit  List of fares for travel on Delta Air Lines from San Francisco  CA to Boston  MA   Applicable booking classes  as well as specific restrictions such as minimum stay and advance purchase can be seen  The Fares data store contains fare tariffs  rule sets  routing maps  class of service tables  and some tax information that construct the price    the fare   Rules like booking conditions  e g  minimum stay  advance purchase  etc   are tailored differently between different city pairs or zones  and assigned a class of service corresponding to its appropriate inventory bucket  Inventory control can also be manipulated manually through the availability feeds  dynamically controlling how many seats are offered for a particular price by opening and closing particular classes  The compiled set of fare conditions is called a fare basis code  There are two systems set up for the interchange of fares data   ATPCO and SITA  plus some system to system direct connects  This system distributes the fare tariffs and rule sets to all GDSs and other subscribers  Every airline employs staff who code air fare rules in accordance with yield management intent  There are also revenue managers who watch fares as they are filed into the public tariffs and make competitive recommendations  Inventory control is typically manipulated from here  using availability feeds to open and close classes of service  The role of the ticketing complex is to issue and store electronic ticket records and the very small number of paper tickets that are still issued  Miscellaneous charges order  MCO  is still a paper document  IATA has working groups defining the replacement document the electronic multipurpose document  EMD  as at       The electronic ticket information is stored in a database containing the data that historically was printed on a paper ticket including items such as the ticket number  the fare and tax components of the ticket price or exchange rate information  In the past  airlines issued paper tickets  since       IATA has been supporting a resolution to move to      electronic ticketing  So far  the industry has not been able to comply due to various technological and international limitations  The industry is at     electronic ticket issuance today  although electronic processing for MCOs was not available in time for the IATA mandate   Notable

Company developed a number of automated airline booking systems known as Reservisor  it first version was an electromechanical version of the flight boards introduced for the  sell and report  system that was installed in American s Boston reservation office in February       These simple vacuum tube and electromechanical computers were based on telephone switching systems made by Teleregister     In the late     s  the American Airles wanted a system that would allow real time access to flight details in all of its offices  and the integration and automation of its booking and ticketing processes  It introduced an electronic reservations system  Magnetronic Reservisor  in          The first computerized booking system was the little known Trans Canada Air Lines  today s Air Canada  system  ReserVec developed by Ferranti Canada   It started to be delivered in April      and by January          completed the airline switch over from the manual systems  Shortly after  in      another computerized reservation system began to be delivered to United Airlines which was one of the largest computer systems at that time  controlling    cities in a communication system that

the table of lessors  need to be updated  The reason given is  Out of date  due to mergers  etc   In particular     and    merged   Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information   September       Aircraft leases are leases used by airlines and other aircraft operators  Airlines lease aircraft from other airlines or leasing companies for two main reasons  to operate aircraft without the financial burden of buying them  as well as to provide temporary increase in capacity  The industry has two main leasing types  wet leasing  which is normally used for short term leasing  and dry leasing which is more normal for longer term leases  The industry also uses combinations of wet and dry  For example  when the aircraft is wet leased to establish new services  then as the airline s flight or cabin crews become trained  they can be switched to a dry lease  In some markets  there may also be hybrid models  such as with crew provided by lessees    Market edit  Operating leases of jet airliner accounted for less than    of the fleet in       then     in the early     s      in      and     in       with lessors involved in     of second hand mid life aircraft transactions since           in Europe and     in North America     In       over      billion worth of commercial aircraft were delivered worldwide and half of the global lessors were based in Ireland     Having an aggressive growth mandate  more aggressive  smaller entrants have overpaid for many of their assets in the sale and leaseback market and are then undercharged on lease rates in order to win the business  with lower maintenance reserves and return conditions  lease rate factors have fallen to      per month       per year   even reaching             per year      Despite Air Berlin and Monarch Airlines bankruptcies  their leased aircraft have been rapidly placed at  normal market rates  due to traffic growth as global revenue passenger kilometers are up by      over one year through September       and Airbus struggles to deliver A   neos due to engine supply delays     In       Beijing allowed Chinese banks to start leasing units  and nine Chinese lessors were part of the    largest in       led by ICBC leasing in the top ten  having the value of their managed fleet grew by     since          In a few cases  Chinese lessors forgot they had to get secondary leases and missed the redelivery timing  stranding aircraft for a few months     Rentals are often anchored to LIBOR rates  A   neo and B    MAX   lease rates are            higher than their predecessors  by       a B      can be leased for slightly more than          per month and a    year term with a good credit can be lower than          per month for an A   neo        of its around     million capital cost   generating     million of revenue and over      million in an end of lease compensation for maintenance  while still being worth     million     Airlines which cannot afford a good deal on factory direct aircraft or carriers who prefer to maintain flexibility can lease their aircraft with an operating lease or a finance lease   Lease types edit  Wet lease edit  A wet lease is a leasing arrangement whereby one airline  the lessor  provides an aircraft  complete crew  maintenance  and insurance  ACMI  to another airline or other type of business acting as a broker of air travel  the lessee   which pays by hours operated  The lessee provides fuel and covers airport fees  and any other duties  taxes  etc  The flight uses the flight number of the lessee  A wet lease generally lasts      months  A wet lease is typically utilized during peak traffic seasons or annual heavy maintenance checks  or to initiate new routes     A wet leased aircraft may be used to fly services into countries where the lessee is banned from operating     It can also be used to replace unavailable capacity or to circumvent regulatory or political  restrictions  They can also be considered a form of charter whereby the lessor provides minimum operating services  including ACMI  and the lessee provides the balance of services along with flight numbers  In all other forms of charter  the lessor provides the flight numbers  Variations of a wet lease include a code share arrangement  a block seat agreement  and a capacity purchase agreement  Wet leases are occasionally used for political reasons  For instance  EgyptAir  an Egyptian government enterprise  for many years was not allowed to fly to Israel under its own name  as a matter of Egyptian government policy  Hence Egyptian civilian flights from Cairo to Tel Aviv  required to exist under the terms of the Egypt Israel peace treaty of       were operated by Air Sinai  which wet leased from EgyptAir to circumvent the political issue      In       Egypt changed its policy and EgyptAir started operating flights to Israel under its own banner              The global wet lease market is projected to grow from US      billion in      to US      billion in       a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of       citation needed   Dry lease edit  A dry lease is a leasing arrangement whereby an aircraft financing entity  lessor   such as AerCap or Air Lease Corporation  provides an aircraft without crew  ground staff  etc  Dry lease is typically used by leasing companies and banks  requiring the lessee to put the aircraft on its own air operator s certificate  AOC  and provide aircraft registration  A typical dry lease lasts upwards of two years and bears certain conditions with respect to depreciation  maintenance  insurances  etc   depending also on the geographical location  political circumstances  etc  A dry lease arrangement can also be made between a major airline and a regional airline  in which the major airline provides the aircraft and the regional operator provides flight crews  maintenance and other operational aspects of the aircraft  which then may be operated under the major airline s name or some similar name  A dry lease saves the major airline the expense of training personnel to fly and maintain the aircraft  along with other considerations  such as staggered union contracts  regional airport staffing  etc    FedEx Express uses an arrangement of this type for its feeder operations  contracting to companies such as Empire Airlines  Mountain Air Cargo  Swiftair  and others to operate its single and twin engined turbo prop  feeder  aircraft in the US   DHL has a joint venture in the United States with Polar Air Cargo  a subsidiary of Atlas Air  to operate their domestic deliveries   UK usage and damp leases edit  In the United Kingdom  a wet lease refers to an aircraft lease in which the aircraft is operated under the air operator s certificate  AOC  of the lessor      An arrangement where the lessor provides the aircraft  flight crew and maintenance but the lessee provides the cabin crew is sometimes referred to as a  damp lease   a term especially used in the UK  it is also occasionally referred to as a  moist lease      In the UK  a dry lease is when an aircraft is operated under the AOC of the lessee       Lessors edit  At the end

airworthiness An Airbus A    from Iberia having its CFM   engine changed out Aircraft maintenance is the performance of tasks required to ensure the continuing airworthiness of an aircraft or aircraft part  including overhaul  inspection  replacement  defect rectification  and the embodiment of modifications  compliance with airworthiness directives and repair          Regulation edit  The maintenance of aircraft is highly regulated  in order to ensure safe and correct functioning during flight  In civil aviation national regulations are coordinated under international standards  established by the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO   The ICAO standards have to be implemented by local airworthiness authorities to regulate the maintenance tasks  personnel and inspection system  Maintenance staff must be licensed for the tasks they carry out     Major airworthiness regulatory authorities include the US Federal Aviation Administration  FAA   European Union Aviation Safety Agency  EASA   Civil Aviation Safety Authority  CASA  from Australia   Civil Aviation Administration of China  CAAC    Aircraft maintenance organization edit  Technicians work on a Bombardier airplane in Dallas  Texas Scheduled maintenance checks edit  Main article  Aircraft maintenance checks Aircraft maintenance in civil aviation generally organized using a maintenance checks or blocks which are packages of maintenance tasks that have to be done on an aircraft after a certain amount of time or usage  Packages are constructed by dividing the maintenance tasks into convenient  bite size chunks to minimize the time the aircraft is out of service  to keep the maintenance workload level  and to maximize the use of maintenance facilities      Pre emptive engine change edit  An engine failure can significantly impact operations and revenue  A programme of calculated pre emptive engine changes  sometimes referred to as  power by the hour   provides budget predictability  avoids installing a loan unit during repairs when an aircraft part fails and enrolled aircraft may have a better value and liquidity  This concept of unscheduled maintenance was initially introduced for aircraft engines to mitigate engine failures     The term was coined by Bristol Siddeley in      to support Vipers of the British Aerospace     business jets for a fixed sum per flying hour     A complete engine and accessory replacement service was provided  allowing the operator to accurately forecast this cost  and relieving him from purchasing stocks of engines and accessories  citation needed  In the     s  Rolls Royce plc reinstated the program to provide the operator with a fixed engine maintenance cost over an extended period of time  Operators are assured of an accurate cost projection and avoid the breakdowns costs  the term is trademarked by Rolls Royce but is the common name in the industry     It is an option for operators of several Rolls Royce

servicing  repairing or replacing of necessary devices  equipment  machinery  building infrastructure and supporting utilities in industrial  business  and residential installations        Terms such as  predictive  or  planned  maintenance describe various cost effective practices aimed at keeping equipment operational  these activities occur either before    or after a potential failure    Definitions edit  Maintenance functions can be defined as maintenance  repair and overhaul  MRO   and MRO is also used for maintenance  repair and operations     Over time  the terminology of maintenance and MRO has begun to become standardized  The United States Department of Defense uses the following definitions      Any activity such as tests  measurements  replacements  adjustments  and repairs intended to retain or restore a functional unit in or to a specified state in which the unit can perform its required functions     All action taken to retain material in a serviceable condition or to restore it to serviceability  It includes inspections  testing  servicing  classification as to serviceability  repair  rebuilding  and reclamation     All supply and repair action taken to keep a force in condition to carry out its mission     The routine recurring work required to keep a facility  plant  building  structure  ground facility  utility system  or other real property  in such condition that it may be continuously used  at its original or designed capacity and efficiency for its intended purpose     Maintenance is strictly connected to the utilization stage of the product or technical system  in which the concept of maintainability must be included  In this scenario  maintainability is considered as the ability of an item  under stated conditions of use  to be retained in or restored to a state in which it can perform its required functions  using prescribed procedures and resources     In some domains like aircraft maintenance  terms maintenance  repair and overhaul    also include inspection  rebuilding  alteration and the supply of spare parts  accessories  raw materials  adhesives  sealants  coatings and consumables for aircraft maintenance at the utilization stage  In international civil aviation maintenance means    The performance of tasks required to ensure the continuing airworthiness of an aircraft  including any one or combination of overhaul  inspection  replacement  defect rectification  and the embodiment of a modification or a repair     This definition covers all activities for which aviation regulations require issuance of a maintenance release document  aircraft certificate of return to service   CRS  Road repair Types edit  The marine and air transportation     offshore structures      industrial plant and facility management industries depend on maintenance  repair and overhaul  MRO  including scheduled or preventive paint maintenance programmes to maintain and restore coatings applied to steel in environments subject to attack from erosion  corrosion and environmental pollution      The basic types of maintenance falling under MRO include   Preventive maintenance  where equipment is checked and serviced in a planned manner  in a scheduled points in time or continuously  Corrective maintenance  where equipment is repaired or replaced after wear  malfunction or break down Reinforcement     Architectural conservation employs MRO to preserve  rehabilitate  restore  or reconstruct historical structures with stone  brick  glass  metal  and wood which match the original constituent materials where possible  or with suitable polymer technologies when not       Preventive maintenance edit  C    J Hercules preventive cleaning at Keesler Air Force Base  Mississippi after a period of operation over the Gulf of Mexico  salt and moisture which lead to active corrosion require regular cleaning  Preventive maintenance  PM  is  a routine for periodically inspecting  with the goal of  noticing small problems and fixing them before major ones develop       Ideally   nothing breaks down       The main goal behind PM is for the equipment to make it from one planned service to the next planned service without any failures caused by fatigue  extreme fluctuation in temperature such as heat waves      during seasonal changes  neglect  or normal wear  preventable items   which Planned Maintenance and Condition Based Maintenance help to achieve by replacing worn components before they actually fail  Maintenance activities include partial or complete overhauls at specified periods  oil changes  lubrication  minor adjustments  and so on  In addition  workers can record equipment deterioration so they know to replace or repair worn parts before they cause system failure  The New York Times gave an example of  machinery that is not lubricated on schedule  that functions  until a bearing burns out   Preventive maintenance contracts are generally a fixed cost  whereas improper maintenance introduces a variable cost  replacement of major equipment      Main objective of PM are   Enhance capital equipment productive life  Reduce critical equipment breakdown  Minimize production loss due to equipment failures  Preventive maintenance or preventative     maintenance  PM  has the following meanings   The care and servicing by personnel for the purpose of maintaining equipment in satisfactory operating condition by providing for systematic inspection  detection  and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects  The work carried out on equipment in order to avoid its breakdown or malfunction  It is a regular and routine action taken on equipment in order to prevent its breakdown      Maintenance  including tests  measurements  adjustments  parts replacement  and cleaning  performed specifically to prevent faults from occurring  Other terms and abbreviations related to PM are   scheduled maintenance     planned maintenance      which may include scheduled downtime for equipment replacement planned preventive maintenance  PPM  is another name for PM     breakdown maintenance      fixing things only when they break  This is also known as  a reactive maintenance strategy      and may involve  consequential damage       Planned maintenance edit   Routine maintenance  redirects here  For the album by Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties  see Routine Maintenance  album   Planned preventive maintenance  PPM   more commonly referred to as simply planned maintenance  PM  or scheduled maintenance  is any variety of scheduled maintenance to an object or item of equipment  Specifically  planned maintenance is a scheduled service visit carried out by a competent and suitable agent  to ensure that an item of equipment is operating correctly and to therefore avoid any unscheduled breakdown and downtime      The key factor as to when and why this work is being done is timing  and involves a service  resource or facility being unavailable          By contrast  condition based maintenance is not directly based on equipment age  Planned maintenance is preplanned  and can be date based  based on equipment running hours  or on distance travelled  Parts that have scheduled maintenance at fixed intervals  usually due to wearout or a fixed shelf life  are sometimes known as time change interval  or TCI items   Predictive maintenance edit  Main article  Predictive maintenance Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in service equipment in order to estimate when maintenance should be performed  This approach promises cost savings over routine or time based preventive maintenance  because tasks are performed only when warranted  Thus  it is regarded as condition based maintenance carried out as suggested by estimations of the degradation state of an item  The main promise of predictive maintenance is to allow convenient scheduling of corrective maintenance  and to prevent unexpected equipment failures     This maintenance strategy uses sensors to monitor key parameters within a machine or system  and uses this data in conjunction with analysed historical trends to continuously evaluate the system health and predict a breakdown before it happens      This strategy allows maintenance to be performed more efficiently  since more up to date data is obtained about how close the product is to failure      Predictive replacement is the replacement of an item that is still functioning properly      Usually it is a tax benefit based  citation needed  replacement policy whereby expensive equipment or batches of individually inexpensive supply items are removed and donated on a predicted fixed shelf life schedule  These items are given to tax exempt institutions      citation needed   Condition based maintenance edit  Condition based maintenance  CBM   shortly described  is maintenance when need arises  Albeit chronologically much older  it is considered one section or practice inside the broader and newer predictive maintenance field  where new AI technologies and connectivity abilities are put to action and where the acronym CBM is more often used to describe  condition based monitoring  rather than the maintenance itself  CBM maintenance is performed after one or more indicators show that equipment is going to fail or that equipment performance is deteriorating  This concept is applicable to mission critical systems that incorporate active redundancy and fault reporting  It is also applicable to non mission critical systems that lack redundancy and fault reporting  Condition based maintenance was introduced to try to maintain the correct equipment at the right time  CBM is based on using real time data to prioritize and optimize maintenance resources  Observing the state of the system is known as condition monitoring  Such a system will determine the equipment s health  and act only when maintenance is actually necessary  Developments in recent years have allowed extensive instrumentation of equipment  and together with better tools for analyzing condition data  the maintenance personnel of today is more than ever able to decide what is the right time to perform maintenance on some piece of equipment  Ideally  condition based maintenance will allow the maintenance personnel to do only the right things  minimizing spare parts cost  system downtime and time spent on maintenance   Challenges edit  Despite its usefulness of equipment  there are several challenges to the use of CBM  First and most important of all  the initial cost of CBM can be high  It requires improved instrumentation of the equipment  Often the cost of sufficient instruments can be quite large  especially on equipment that is already installed  Wireless systems have reduced the initial cost  Therefore  it is important for the installer to decide the importance of the investment before adding CBM to all equipment  A result of this cost is that the first generation of CBM in the oil and gas industry has only focused on vibration in heavy rotating equipment  Secondly  introducing CBM will invoke a major change in how maintenance is performed  and potentially to the whole maintenance organization in a company  Organizational changes are in general difficult  Also  the technical side of it is not always as simple  Even if some types of equipment can easily be observed by measuring simple values such as vibration  displacement  velocity or acceleration   temperature or pressure  it is not trivial to turn this measured data into actionable knowledge about the health of the equipment   Value potential edit  As systems get more costly  and equipment and information systems tend to become cheaper and more reliable  CBM becomes an important tool for running a plant or factory in an optimal manner  Better operations will lead to lower production cost and lower use of resources  Lower use of resources may be one of the most important differentiators in a future where environmental issues become more important by the day  Another scenario where value can be created is by monitoring the health of a car motor  Rather than changing parts at predefined intervals  the car itself can tell you when something needs to be changed based on cheap and simple instrumentation  It is Department of Defense policy that condition based maintenance  CBM  be  implemented to improve maintenance agility and responsiveness  increase operational availability  and reduce life cycle total ownership costs        Advantages and disadvantages edit  CBM has some advantages over planned maintenance   Improved system reliability Decreased maintenance costs Decreased number of maintenance operations causes a reduction of human error influences Its disadvantages are   High installation costs  for minor equipment items often more than the value of the equipment Unpredictable maintenance periods cause costs to be divided unequally  Increased number of parts  the CBM installation itself  that need maintenance and checking  Today  due to its costs  CBM is not used for less important parts of machinery despite obvious advantages  However it can be found everywhere where increased safety is required  and in future will be applied even more widely           Corrective maintenance edit  Main article  Corrective maintenance Corrective maintenance is a type of maintenance used for equipment after equipment break down or malfunction is often most expensive   not only can worn equipment damage other parts and cause multiple damage  but consequential repair and replacement costs and loss of revenues due to down time during overhaul can be significant  Rebuilding and resurfacing of equipment and infrastructure damaged by erosion and corrosion as part of corrective or preventive maintenance programmes involves conventional processes such

servicing aircraft between flights Time lapse of ground support equipment in use at Osaka International Airport  Osaka  Japan Ground support equipment  GSE  is the support equipment found at an airport  usually on the apron  the servicing area by the terminal  This equipment is used to service the aircraft between flights  As the name suggests  ground support equipment is there to support the operations of aircraft whilst on the ground  The role of this equipment generally involves ground power operations  aircraft mobility  and cargo passenger loading operations  Many airlines subcontract ground handling to an airport or a handling agent  or even to another airline  Ground handling addresses the many service requirements of a passenger aircraft between the time it arrives at a terminal gate and the time it departs for its next flight  Speed  efficiency  and accuracy are important in ground handling services in order to minimize the turnaround time  the time during which the aircraft remains parked at the gate   Small airlines sometimes subcontract maintenance to a larger carrier  as it may be a better alternative to setting up an independent maintenance base  Some airlines may enter into a Maintenance and Ground Support Agreement  MAGSA  with each other  which is used by airlines to assess costs for maintenance and support to aircraft  not verified in body  Most ground services are not directly related to the actual flying of the aircraft  and instead involve other service tasks  Cabin services ensure passenger comfort and safety  They include such tasks as cleaning the passenger cabin and replenishment of on board consumables or washable items such as soap  pillows  tissues  blankets  and magazines  Security checks are also made to make sure no threats have been left on the aircraft  Airport GSE comprises a diverse range of vehicles and equipment necessary to service aircraft during passenger and cargo loading and unloading  maintenance  and other ground based operations  The wide range of activities associated with aircraft ground operations lead to an equally wide ranging fleet of GSE  For example  activities undertaken during a typical aircraft gate period include  cargo loading and unloading  passenger loading and unloading  potable water storage  lavatory waste tank drainage  aircraft refueling  engine and fuselage examination and maintenance  and food and beverage catering  Airlines employ specially designed GSE to support all these operations  Moreover  electrical power and conditioned air are generally required throughout gate operational periods for both passenger and crew comfort and safety  and many times these services are also provided by GSE       Non powered equipment edit  Dollies edit    Main article  airport dolly Dollies are used for the transportation of loose baggages  oversized bags  mail bags  loose cargo carton boxes  etc  between the aircraft and the terminal or sorting facility  Dollies for loose baggage are fitted with a brake system which blocks the wheels from moving when the connecting rod is not attached to a tug  Most dollies for loose baggage are completely enclosed except for the sides which use plastic curtains to protect items from weather  In the US  these dollies are called Baggage Cart  but in Europe Baggage Cart means passenger baggage trolleys   Gallery edit   Airport dolly

Chocks edit  Main article  wheel chock Chocks Chocks being fitted to a British Airways Airbus A     Chocks are used to prevent an aircraft from moving while parked at the gate or in a hangar  Chocks are placed in the front   fore   and back   aft   of the wheels of landing gear  They are made out of hard wood or hard rubber  Corporate safety guidelines in the US almost always specify that chocks must be used in a pair on the same wheel and they must be placed in physical contact with the wheel  Therefore   chocks  are typically found in pairs connected by a segment of rope or cable  The word  chock  is also used as a verb  defined as the act of placing chocks in front and back of the wheel    Aircraft tripod jack edit  Aircraft jack lift used to support the tail of an EVA Air Boeing     to avoid the aircraft tail from falling to ground during the cargo loading unloading activity in which the  tail heavy  situation may occur  They are used to support a parked aircraft to prevent their tail from drooping or even falling to the ground  When the passengers in the front get off an aircraft  the aircraft becomes tail heavy and the tail will droop  Using the jack is optional but not all aircraft need it  When needed  they are tugged to the tail and set up by manpower  Once set up  no supervision to the jack is needed until the aircraft is ready to leave    Aircraft service stairs

equipment edit  Refuelers edit  Aircraft refuelers can be either a self contained fuel truck  or a hydrant truck cart  this variant sometimes called servicer   Fuel trucks are self contained  typically containing up to        US gallons         imp gal         L  of fuel and have their own pumps  filters  hoses  and other equipment  A hydrant cart or truck hooks into a central pipeline network and provides fuel to the aircraft  There is a significant advantage with hydrant systems when compared to fuel trucks  as fuel trucks must be periodically replenished    Refueler gallery

purposes and represent the essential part of ground support services  They are used to move all equipment that can not move itself  This includes bag carts  mobile air conditioning units  air starters  and lavatory carts    Ground power units edit  Ground power unit that needs towing  A ground power unit  GPU  is a vehicle capable of supplying power to aircraft parked on the ground     Ground power units may also be built into the jetway  making it even easier to supply electrical power to aircraft  Many aircraft require    V of direct current and     V     Hz of alternating current  The electric energy is carried from a generator to a connection on the aircraft via   phase   wire insulated cable capable of handling     amps     kVA   These connectors are standard for all aircraft  as defined in ISO          A so called  solid state unit  converts power from AC to DC along with current separation for aircraft power requirements  Solid state units can be supplied stationary  bridge mounted or as a mobile unit       Buses edit  Main article  Airport bus Soviet apron bus Buses at airports are used to move people from the terminal to either an aircraft or another terminal  The specific term for airport buses that drive on the apron only is apron bus  Apron buses may have a low profile like the Guangtai or Neoplan aircraft buses because people disembark directly to the apron  Some airports use buses that are raised to the level of a passenger terminal and can only be accessed from a door on the  nd level of the terminal  These odd looking buses are usually referred to as  people movers  or  mobile lounges   Airport buses are usually normal city buses or specialized terminal buses  Specialized airport buses have very low floor and wide doors on both sides of the bus for most efficient passenger movement and flexibility in depot parking  The biggest producers of airport buses are in China  Weihai  Shenyang  Beijing  Jinhua   Portugal and Slovenia  specify    Container loader edit  Container loaders  also known as cargo loaders or  K loaders   are used for the loading and unloading of containers and pallets into and out of aircraft  The loader has two platforms which raise and descend independently  The containers or pallets on the loader are moved with the help of built in rollers or wheels  There are different container and pallet loaders       T   T  standard version  wide body  universal  high     T    T For military transport planes special container and pallet loaders are used  Some military applications use airborne loaders  which are transportable within the transport plane itself  Container and pallet loaders are mainly produced in France  Germany  Latvia  Spain  Canada  Brazil  Japan  China  and the United States    Container

Transporters are cargo platforms constructed so that  beside loading and unloading containers  they can also transport the cargo  These transporters are not typically used in the United States    Air start unit edit  Volkswagen Type    T   jet air starter An air start unit  ASU  also known as a  start cart   is a device used to start an aircraft s engines when it is not equipped with an on board APU or the APU is not operational     There are three primary types of these devices that exist currently  a stored air cart  a gas turbine based unit  and a diesel engine driven screw compressor unit  All three devices create a source of low pressure  high volume air to start the aircraft engines  Typically one or two hoses are connected to these units  with the largest aircraft engines requiring three       Non potable water trucks edit  Non potable water trucks are special vehicles that provide water to an aircraft  The water is filtered and protected from the elements while being stored on the vehicle  A pump in the vehicle assists in moving the water from the truck to the aircraft  The water is designated  as non potable    Lavatory service vehicles edit  See also  Blue ice  aircraft

Lavatory service vehicles empty and refill lavatories onboard aircraft  Waste is stored in tanks on the aircraft until these vehicles can empty them and remove the waste  After the tank is emptied  it is refilled with a mixture of water and a disinfecting concentrate  commonly called  blue juice   Instead of a self powered vehicle  some airports have lavatory carts  which are smaller and must be pulled by tug   Catering vehicle edit  The catering vehicle resembles a typical box truck but it consists of a rear body  lifting system  platform and an electro hydraulic control mechanism  The rear body can be lifted up  down and the platform can be moved to place in front of the aircraft  Catering services include the unloading of unused food and drink from the aircraft  and the loading of fresh food and drinks for passengers and crew  The meals are typically delivered on standardized carts  which are wheeled into the catering vehicle  Meals are prepared mostly on the ground in order to minimize the amount of preparation  apart from chilling or reheating  required during flight   The vehicle then drives to the airport and is parked in front of the plane  The stabilizers are deployed and the van body is lifted  The platform can be fine controlled to move left right as well as in out so that it is aligned with the door correctly  The body is made of insulated panels and is capable of maintaining temperatures of    C      F  by means of refrigeration unit  In flight food is prepared in a flight kitchen facility  a completely HACCP certified facility where food is reheated in sterile and controlled environments  The prepared food is then placed in trollies and wheeled into the cabin   A predecessor to the catering truck was in use by the U S  Army Air Forces during World War II     A special higher type of catering truck has been designed to accommodate the Airbus A         Wikimedia Commons has media related to Aircraft catering    Catering vehicle gallery   Two

Passenger boarding stairs  sometimes referred to as boarding ramps  stair car or aircraft steps  provide a mobile means to traverse between the aircraft doors and the ground  Because larger aircraft have door sills   to    feet      to     m  high  stairs facilitate safe boarding and deplaning  Smaller units are generally moved by being towed or pushed  while larger units are self powered  Most models have adjustable height to accommodate various aircraft  Optional features may include canopies  heating  supplementary lighting  and a red carpet for VIP passengers  Larger aircraft may use one or more jet bridges connected to the terminal building for passenger boarding  but ground based stairs are used when this is unavailable or impractical    Pushback tugs and tractors edit  Main article  Pushback  aviation  Pushback tugs are mostly used to push an aircraft away from the gate when it is ready to leave  These tugs are very powerful and because of the large engines  are sometimes referred to as an engine with wheels  Pushback tugs can also be used to pull aircraft in various situations  such as to a hangar  Different size tugs are required for different size aircraft  Some tugs use a tow bar as a connection between the tug and the aircraft  while other tugs lift the nose gear off the ground to make it easier to tow or push  Recently there has been a push for towbarless tractors as larger airplanes are designed    Tugs and tractors gallery   A pushback tug with towbar attached    A conventional tractor hooked up to a United Airlines Boeing        ER at Denver

newspapers   books   scholar   JSTOR  March        Learn how and when to remove this message  The center of gravity  CG  of an aircraft is the point over which the aircraft would balance     Its position is calculated after supporting the aircraft on at least two sets of weighing scales or load cells and noting the weight shown on each set of scales or load cells   The center of gravity affects the stability of the aircraft  To ensure the aircraft is safe to fly  the center of gravity must fall within specified limits established by the aircraft manufacturer    Terminology edit  The nose baggage compartment of a Fokker F XII in       avoiding the problem of heavy weights towards the rear Ballast Ballast is removable or permanently installed weight in an aircraft used to bring the center of gravity into the allowable range  Center of Gravity Limits Center of gravity  CG  limits are specified longitudinal  forward and aft  and or lateral  left and right  limits within which the aircraft s center of gravity must be located during flight  The CG limits are indicated in the airplane flight manual  The area between the limits is called the CG range of the aircraft  Weight and Balance When the weight of the aircraft is at or below the allowable limit s  for its configuration  parked  ground movement  take off  landing  etc   and its center of gravity is within the allowable range  and both will remain so for the duration of the flight  the aircraft is said to be within weight and balance   Different maximum weights may be defined for different situations  for example  large aircraft may have maximum landing weights that are lower than maximum take off weights  because some weight is expected to be lost as fuel is burned during the flight    The center of gravity may change over the duration of the flight as the aircraft s weight changes due to fuel burn or by passengers moving forward or aft in the cabin  Reference Datum The reference datum is a reference plane that allows accurate  and uniform  measurements to any point on the aircraft  The location of the reference datum is established by the manufacturer and is defined in the aircraft flight manual  The horizontal reference datum is an imaginary vertical plane or point  placed along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft  from which all horizontal distances are measured for weight and balance purposes  There is no fixed rule for its location  and it may be located forward of the nose of the aircraft  For helicopters  it may be located at the rotor mast  the nose of the helicopter  or even at a point in space ahead of the helicopter  While the horizontal reference datum can be anywhere the manufacturer chooses  most small training helicopters have the horizontal reference datum     inches forward of the main rotor shaft centerline  This is to keep all the computed values positive  The lateral reference datum is usually located at the center of the helicopter     Arm The arm is the horizontal distance from the reference datum to the center of gravity  CG  of an item  The algebraic sign is plus     if measured aft of the datum or to the right side of the center line when considering a lateral calculation  The algebraic sign is minus     if measured forward of the datum or the left side of the center line when considering a lateral calculation     Moment The moment is the moment of force  or torque  that results from an object s weight acting through an arc that is centered on the zero point of the reference datum distance  Moment is also referred to as the tendency of an object to rotate or pivot about a point  the zero point of the datum  in this case   The further an object is from this point  the greater the force it exerts  Moment is calculated by multiplying the weight of an object by its arm  Mean Aerodynamic Chord  MAC  A specific chord line of a tapered wing   At the mean aerodynamic chord  the center of pressure has the same aerodynamic force  position  and area as it does on the rest of the wing   The MAC represents the width of an equivalent rectangular wing in given conditions   On some aircraft  the center of gravity is expressed as a percentage of the length of the MAC   In order to make such a calculation  the position of the leading edge of the MAC must be known ahead of time   This position is defined as a distance from the reference datum and is found in the aircraft s flight manual and also on the aircraft s type certificate data sheet  If a general MAC is not given but a LeMAC  leading edge mean aerodynamic chord  and a TeMAC  trailing edge mean aerodynamic chord  are given  both of which would be referenced as an arm measured out from the datum line  then your MAC can be found by finding the difference between your LeMAC and your TeMAC  Calculation edit  A sample CG moment envelope chart  showing that a loaded plane weighing       lb        kg  with a moment of         lb in        N m  is within the  normal category  envelope  Center of gravity  CG  is calculated as follows   Determine weights and arms for all mass within the aircraft  Multiply weights by arms for all mass to calculate moments  Add all moments together  Add all weights together  Divide total moment by total weight to give overall arm  The arm that results from this calculation must be within the center of gravity limits dictated by the aircraft manufacturer   If it is not  weight in the aircraft must be removed  added  rarely   or redistributed until the center of gravity falls within the prescribed limits  Aircraft center of gravity calculations are only performed along a single axis from the zero point of the reference datum that represents the longitudinal axis of the aircraft  to calculate fore to aft balance   Some helicopter types utilize lateral CG limits as well as longitudinal limits  Operation of such helicopters requires calculating CG along two axes  one calculation for longitudinal CG  fore to aft balance  and another calculation for lateral CG  left to right balance   The weight  arm  and moment values of the fixed items on the aircraft  i e  engines  wings  electronic components  do not change and are provided by the manufacturer on the Aircraft Equipment List  The manufacturer also provides information facilitating the calculation of moments for fuel loads  Removable weight items  i e  crew members  passengers  baggage  must be properly accounted for in the weight and CG calculation by the aircraft operator   Example edit      Weight  lb   Arm  in   Moment  lb in    Empty

gravity  we divide the total moment by the total weight                          inches behind the datum plane  In larger aircraft  weight and balance is often expressed as a percentage of mean aerodynamic chord  or MAC   For example  assume the leading edge of the MAC is    inches aft of the datum   Therefore  the CG calculated above lies    inches aft of the leading edge of the MAC   If the MAC is    inches in length  the percentage of MAC is                If the allowable limits were     to      the aircraft would not be properly loaded   Incorrect weight and balance in fixed wing aircraft edit  The center of gravity of this British Aerospace     shifted rearward when its engines were removed  As a result  it tipped back onto its rear fuselage in windy conditions  When the weight or center of gravity of an aircraft is outside the acceptable range  the aircraft may not be able to sustain flight  or it may be impossible to maintain the aircraft in level flight in some or all circumstances  in some events resulting in load shifting   Placing the CG or weight of an aircraft outside the allowed range can lead to an unavoidable crash of the aircraft   Center of gravity out of range edit  When the fore aft center of gravity  CG  is out of range  serious aircraft control problems can occur   The fore aft CG affects the longitudinal stability of the aircraft  with the stability increasing as the CG moves forward and decreasing as the CG moves aft  With a forward CG position  although the stability of the aircraft increases  the elevator control authority is reduced in the capability of raising the nose of the aircraft   This can cause a serious condition during the landing flare when the nose cannot be raised sufficiently to slow the aircraft   An aft CG position can cause severe handling problems due to the reduced pitch stability and increased elevator control sensitivity  with potential loss of aircraft control   Because the burning of fuel gradually produces a loss of weight and possibly a shift in the CG  it is possible for an aircraft to take off with the CG within normal operating range  and yet later develop an imbalance that results in control problems   Calculations of CG must take this into account  often part of this is calculated in advance by the manufacturer and incorporated into CG limits    Adjusting CG within limits edit  The amount a weight must be moved can be found by using the following formula  shift distance    total weight   cg change    weight shifted  Example        lb        in          moment  airplane      lb      in         moment  baggage  cg      in                           lb      in out of cg limit   We want to move the CG   in using a     lb bag in the baggage compartment   shift

pilot weight is often specified   but all impose a maximum weight   If the maximum weight is exceeded  the aircraft may not be able to achieve or sustain controlled flight   Excessive take off weight may make it impossible to take off within available runway lengths  or it may completely prevent take off   Excessive weight in flight may make climbing beyond a certain altitude difficult or impossible  or it may make it impossible to maintain an altitude   Incorrect weight and balance in helicopters edit  The center of gravity is even more critical for helicopters than it is for fixed wing aircraft  weight issues remain the same   As with fixed wing aircraft  a helicopter may be properly loaded for takeoff  but near the end of a long flight when the fuel tanks are almost empty  the CG may have shifted enough for the helicopter to be out of balance laterally or longitudinally     For helicopters with a single main rotor  the CG is usually close to the main rotor mast  Improper balance of a helicopter s load can result in serious control problems  In addition to making a helicopter difficult to control  an out of balance loading condition also decreases maneuverability since cyclic control is less effective in the direction opposite to the CG location  The pilot tries to perfectly balance a helicopter so that the fuselage remains horizontal in hovering flight  with no cyclic pitch control needed except for wind correction  Since the fuselage acts as a pendulum suspended from the rotor  changing the center of gravity changes the angle at which the aircraft hangs from the rotor  When the center of gravity is directly under the rotor mast  the helicopter hangs horizontal  if the CG is too far forward of the mast  the helicopter hangs with its nose tilted down  if the CG is too far aft of the mast  the nose tilts up   CG forward of forward limit edit  A forward CG may occur when a heavy pilot and passenger take off without baggage or proper ballast located aft of the rotor mast  This situation becomes worse if the fuel tanks are located aft of the rotor mast because as fuel burns the weight located aft of the rotor mast becomes less  This condition is recognizable when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff  The helicopter will have a nose low attitude  and the pilot will need excessive rearward displacement of the cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no wind condition  In this condition  the pilot could rapidly run out of rearward cyclic control as the helicopter consumes fuel  The pilot may also find it impossible to decelerate sufficiently to bring the helicopter to a stop  In the event of engine failure and the resulting autorotation  the pilot may not have enough cyclic control to flare properly for the landing  A forward CG will not be as obvious when hovering into a strong wind  since less rearward cyclic displacement is required than when hovering with no wind  When determining whether a critical balance condition exists  it is essential to consider the wind velocity and its relation to the rearward displacement of the cyclic control   CG aft of aft limit edit  Without proper ballast in the cockpit  exceeding the aft CG may occur when   A lightweight pilot takes off solo with a full load of fuel located aft of the rotor mast  A lightweight pilot takes off with maximum baggage allowed in a baggage compartment located aft of the rotor mast  A lightweight pilot takes off with a combination of baggage and substantial fuel where both are aft of the rotor mast  An aft CG condition can be recognized by the pilot when coming to a hover following a vertical takeoff  The helicopter will have a tail low attitude  and the pilot will need excessive forward displacement of cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no wind condition  If there is a wind  the pilot needs even greater forward cyclic  If flight is continued in this condition  the pilot may find it impossible to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose low attitude  In addition  with an extreme aft CG  gusty or rough air could accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced with full forward cyclic control  In this case  dissymmetry of lift and blade flapping could cause the rotor disc to tilt aft  With full forward cyclic control already applied  the rotor disc might not be able to be lowered  resulting in possible loss of control  or the rotor blades striking the tail boom   Lateral balance edit  In fixed wing aircraft  lateral balance is often much less critical than fore aft balance  simply because most mass in the aircraft is located very close to its center   An exception is fuel  which may be loaded into the wings  but since fuel loads are usually symmetrical about the axis of the aircraft  lateral balance is not usually affected   The lateral center of gravity may become important if the fuel is not loaded evenly into tanks on both sides of the aircraft  or  in the case of small aircraft  when passengers are predominantly on one side of the aircraft  such as a pilot flying alone in a small aircraft    Small lateral deviations of CG that are within limits may cause an annoying roll tendency that pilots must compensate for  but they are not dangerous as long as the CG remains within limits for the duration of the flight  For most helicopters  it is usually not necessary to determine the lateral CG for normal flight instruction and passenger flights  This is because helicopter cabins are relatively narrow and most optional equipment is located near the center line  However  some helicopter manuals specify the seat from which solo flight must be conducted  In addition  if there is an unusual situation  such as a heavy pilot and a full load of fuel on one side of the helicopter  which could affect the lateral CG  its position should be checked against the CG envelope  If carrying external loads in a position that requires large lateral cyclic control displacement to maintain level flight  fore and aft cyclic effectiveness could be dramatically limited   Fuel dumping and overweight operations edit  Many large transport category aircraft are able to take off at a greater weight than they can land   This is possible because the weight of fuel that the wings can support along their span in flight  or when parked or taxiing on the ground  is greater than they can tolerate during the stress of landing and touchdown  when the support is not distributed along the span of the wing  Normally the portion of the aircraft s weight that exceeds the maximum landing weight  but falls within the maximum take off weight  is entirely composed of fuel   As the aircraft flies  the fuel burns off  and by the time the aircraft is ready to land  it is below its maximum landing weight   However  if an aircraft must land early  sometimes the fuel that remains aboard still keeps the aircraft over the maximum landing weight   When this happens  the aircraft must either burn off the fuel  by flying in a holding pattern  or dump it  if the aircraft is equipped to do this  before landing to avoid damage to the aircraft   In an emergency  an aircraft may choose to land overweight  but this may damage it  and at the very least an overweight landing will mandate a thorough inspection to check for any damage  In some cases  an aircraft may take off overweight deliberately   An example might be an aircraft being ferried over a very long distance with extra fuel aboard   An overweight take off typically requires an exceptionally long runway   Overweight operations are not permitted with passengers aboard  Many smaller aircraft have a maximum landing weight that is the same as the maximum take off weight  in which case issues of overweight landing due to excess fuel being on board cannot arise   CG of large commercial transport aircraft edit  This section shows data obtained from a

Accidents edit  Air Midwest Flight       in January       a Beech     D was dispatched with more than     lb      kg  over its maximum weight  and mostly in the rear so its center of gravity was    aft  It crashed killing all    on board     In February       a Challenger     departed Teterboro  New Jersey  loaded so far forward that it was out of the CG limit and it could not rotate  crashed through the airport fence into a building  severely injuring three occupants and destroying the aircraft     In August       a Filair Let L     crashed in the Democratic Republic of Congo  The accident was reportedly the result of the occupants rushing to the front of the aircraft to escape from a crocodile smuggled on board by one of the passengers  The move compromised the aircraft s balance to the point that control of the aircraft was lost     In July       a de Havilland Canada DHC   Otter departed Soldotna  Alaska  stalled after rotation and crashed       ft      m  away from its brake release point as it was overloaded by     lb      kg  and its CG was well aft of the rear limit  All ten occupants died     See also edit  Index of aviation articles Weight distribution

Service to direct pilots of aircraft  Air traffic  redirects here  For the Canadian band  see Air Traffic Control  band   For the Owl City song  see Maybe I m Dreaming  This article is about civilian direction of aircraft  For other types of aircraft control  see Air control    The air traffic control tower of Mumbai International Airport in India Air traffic control  ATC  is a service provided by ground based air traffic controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and through controlled airspace  The primary purpose of ATC is to prevent collisions  organise and expedite the flow of air traffic  and provide information and other support for pilots     In some countries  ATC can also provide advisory services to aircraft in non controlled airspace   Controllers monitor the location of aircraft in their assigned airspace using radar and communicate with pilots by radio     To prevent collisions  ATC enforces traffic separation rules  which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of empty space around it  ATC services are provided to all types of aircraft  including private  military  and commercial flights     Depending on the type of flight and the class of airspace  ATC may issue mandatory instructions or non binding advisories  known as flight information in some countries   While pilots are required to obey all ATC instructions  the pilot in command of an aircraft always retains final authority for its safe operation  In an emergency  the pilot may deviate from ATC instructions to the extent required to maintain the safety of the aircraft     Weather conditions such as thunderstorms  strong winds  and low visibility can significantly affect air traffic control operations  leading to delays  diversions  and the need for alternate routing       Language edit  Pursuant to requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO   ATC operations are conducted either in the English language  or the local language used by the station on the ground     In practice  the native language for a region is used  however  English must be used upon request      See also  Aeronautical phraseology and Aviation English History edit  In       Croydon Airport near London  England  was the first airport in the world to introduce air traffic control      The  aerodrome control tower  was a wooden hut    feet    metres  high with windows on all four sides   It was commissioned on    February       and provided basic traffic  weather  and location information to pilots        In the United States  air traffic control developed three divisions  The first of several air mail radio stations  AMRS  was created in       after World War I  when the U S  Post Office began using techniques developed by the U S  Army to direct and track the movements of reconnaissance aircraft  Over time  the AMRS morphed into flight service stations  Today s flight service stations do not issue control instructions  but provide pilots with many other flight related informational services  They do relay control instructions from ATC in areas where flight service is the only facility with radio or phone coverage  The first airport traffic control tower  regulating arrivals  departures  and surface movement of aircraft in the US at a specific airport  opened in Cleveland in       Approach  and departure control facilities were created after adoption of radar in the     s to monitor and control the busy airspace around larger airports  The first air route traffic control center  ARTCC   which directs the movement of aircraft between departure and destination  was opened in Newark in       followed in      by Chicago and Cleveland      After the      Grand Canyon mid air collision  killing all     on board  the FAA was given the air traffic responsibility in the United States in       and this was followed by other countries  In       Britain  France  Germany  and the Benelux countries set up Eurocontrol  intending to merge their airspaces  The first and only attempt to pool controllers between countries is the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre  MUAC   founded in      by Eurocontrol  and covering Belgium  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  and north western Germany  In       the European Union  EU  aimed to create a  Single European Sky   hoping to boost efficiency and gain economies of scale      In the USSR  the first air traffic control service was organized in      on the Moscow   Irkutsk air route  in       control areas were defined along all existing air routes       Airport traffic control tower edit  Control tower at S o Paulo Guarulhos International Airport Control tower at Birmingham Airport  England Small control tower at R ysk l  Airfield in Loppi  Finland The primary method of controlling the immediate airport environment is visual observation from the airport control tower  The tower is typically a tall  windowed structure  located within the airport grounds  The air traffic controllers  usually abbreviated  controller   are responsible for separation and efficient movement of aircraft and vehicles operating on the taxiways and runways of the airport itself  and aircraft in the air near the airport  generally   to    nautical miles    to    kilometres    to    miles   depending on the airport procedures  A controller must carry out the job using the precise and effective application of rules and procedures  however  they need flexible adjustments according to differing circumstances  often under time pressure      In a study which compared stress in the general population and among staff working in this kind of system  there was markedly showed more stress level for controllers  This variation can be explained  at least in part  by the characteristics of the job      Remote and virtual tower  RVT  is a system based on air traffic controllers being located somewhere other than at the local airport tower  and still able to provide air traffic control services               Ground control edit  Inside Pope Field air traffic control tower Ground control  sometimes known as ground movement control  GMC  is responsible for the airport movement areas      Some busier airports have surface movement radar  SMR        Air control or local control edit  Air control  known to pilots as tower or tower control  is responsible for the active runway surfaces       Flight data and clearance delivery edit  Clearance delivery is the position that issues route clearances to aircraft  typically before they commence taxiing  These clearances contain details of the route that the aircraft is expected to fly after departure       Analogous use edit  In the field of supply chain management  the concept of a  supply chain control tower  reflects the  end to end visibility  provided by an air traffic control tower      Ashutoch Gupta  writing for Gartner  observes that a supply chain control tower can be established  by combining people  process  data  organization and technology to improve visibility  control and decision making        Approach and terminal control edit   TRACON  redirects here  For the video game series  see TRACON  series   See also  Terminal control area Potomac Consolidated TRACON in Warrenton  Virginia  United States In the U S   TRACONs are additionally designated by a three digit alphanumeric code   For example  the Chicago TRACON is designated C         Area control centre   en route centre edit  Main article  Area control center The training department at the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center  Leesburg  Virginia  United States An area control center  as opposed to a terminal control center  is a specific type of air traffic control center that primarily controls IFR traffic  or aircraft at high altitude flying by instruments  instead of aircraft that are landing or taking off       Each area control center is assigned a flight information region   and certain area control centers near the coast are also tasked with monitoring aircraft flying over the ocean       Area control centers perform similar duties to other types of air traffic control  such as rerouting aircraft to deal with adverse conditions and directing the course of aircraft to ensure seperation   Radar coverage edit  Unmanned radar on a remote mountain In the past  data on the position if aircraft were mainly determined by the following types of radar   En route radar with a coverage up to     NM      km  Airport surveillance radar  with a coverage up to of    NM     km  of the airport below an elevation of        feet Surface movement radar with a coverage of the airport surface  within   NM      km  Secondary surveillance radar with a coverage within line of sight range E route radar with primary and secondary radar antennas Airport surveillance radar with primary and secondary radar antennas Stand alone secondary surveillance radar In addition to such types of radar  some air navigation service providers  e g   Airservices Australia  the U S  Federal Aviation Administration  Nav Canada  etc   have implemented automatic dependent surveillance   broadcast  ADS B  as part of their surveillance capability   This newer technology reverses the radar concept   Instead of radar  finding  a target by interrogating the transponder  the ADS B equipped aircraft  broadcasts  a position report as determined by the navigation equipment on board the aircraft   ADS C is another mode of automatic dependent surveillance  however ADS C operates in the  contract  mode  where the aircraft reports a position  automatically or initiated by the pilot  based on a predetermined time interval   It is also possible for controllers to request more frequent reports to more quickly establish aircraft position for specific reasons       However  since the cost for each report is charged by the ADS service providers to the company operating the aircraft  disputed   discuss  more frequent reports are not commonly requested  except in emergency situations   ADS C is significant  because it can be used where it is not possible to locate the infrastructure for a radar system  e g   over water    Computerised radar displays are now being designed to accept ADS C inputs as part of their display      verification needed  A radar archive system  RAS  keeps an electronic record of all radar information  preserving it for a few weeks   This information can be useful for search and rescue   When an aircraft has  disappeared  from radar screens  a controller can review the last radar returns from the aircraft to determine its likely position   For an example  see the crash report in the following citation       Problems edit  Traffic edit  Further information  Air traffic flow management Intersecting contrails of aircraft over London  an area of high air traffic Air traffic control errors occur when the separation  either vertical or horizontal  between airborne aircraft falls below the minimum prescribed separation set  for the domestic United States  by the US Federal Aviation Administration   Separation minimums for terminal control areas  TCAs  around airports are lower than en route standards   Errors generally occur during periods following times of intense activity  when controllers tend to relax and overlook the presence of traffic and conditions that lead to loss of minimum separation      text source integrity    Weather edit  Aircraft taking off from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport with the ATC tower in the background According to the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation  CANSO   weather significantly impacts global aviation  with more than     of air traffic delays being attributed to adverse weather conditions  These disruptions cause widespread delays  rerouting by ATC  and cancellations across continents  In       Europe experienced a     increase in weather related en route delays compared to       As increasingly adverse weather intensifies the frequency and severity of these events  CANSO urged collaboration and real time solutions among global aviation stakeholders to mitigate the effects of weather on flight operations      Infrastructure edit  Global ATC infrastructure is a complex network that varies significantly by region  with many countries facing challenges related to outdated technology  staffing shortages  and increasing traffic demand  While some regions  like parts of Europe and the U S   have implemented modernization programs such as SESAR and NextGen      many others  especially in developing nations  still rely on legacy radar systems and voice based communication  which limit efficiency and safety  These disparities contribute to delays and reduce the overall resilience of global air traffic management  According to the ICAO  coordinating ATC systems and accelerating digitalization is essential for meeting future aviation demands       Similarly  a      report from the International Air Transport Association  IATA  emphasizes the urgency of investing in scalable  data driven infrastructure to handle post pandemic growth and ensure sustainability across the network       Congestion edit  Constrained control capacity and growing traffic lead to flight cancellation and delays           In America  delays caused by ATC grew by     between      and            ATC staffing issues were a major factor in congestion      By then the market for air traffic services was worth    bn   More efficient ATC could save       of aviation fuel by avoiding holding patterns and indirect airways      The military takes     of Chinese airspace  congesting the thin corridors open to airliners   The United Kingdom closes its military airspace only during military exercises       Call signs edit  A prerequisite to safe air traffic separation is the assignment and use of distinctive call signs   These are permanently allocated by ICAO on request  usually to scheduled flights  and some air forces and other military services for military flights   There are written call signs with a two or three letter combination followed by the flight number such as AAL    or VLG       As such  they appear on flight plans and ATC radar labels   There are also the audio or radio telephony call signs used on the radio contact between pilots and air traffic control   These are not always identical to their written counterparts   An example of an audio call sign would be  Speedbird       instead of the written  BAW       This is used to reduce the chance of confusion between ATC and the aircraft   By default  the call sign for any other flight is the registration number  or tail number in US parlance  of the aircraft  such as  N         C GABC   or  EC IZD    The short radio telephony call signs for these tail numbers is the last three letters using the NATO phonetic alphabet  e g  ABC  spoken alpha bravo charlie for C GABC   or the last three numbers  e g  three four five for N         In the United States  the prefix may be an aircraft type  model  or manufacturer in place of the first registration character  for example   N       could become  Cessna            Technology edit  The Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  has spent over US   billion on software  but a fully automated system is still yet to be achieved   In       the United Kingdom commissioned a new area control centre into service at the London Area Control Centre  LACC  at Swanwick in Hampshire  relieving a busy suburban centre at West Drayton in Middlesex  north of London Heathrow Airport   Software from Lockheed Martin predominates at the London Area Control Centre   However  the centre was initially troubled by software and communications problems causing delays and occasional shutdowns      Some tools are available in different domains to help the controller further   Flight data processing systems  this is the system  usually one per centre  that processes all the information related to the flight  the flight plan   typically in the time horizon from gate to gate  airport departure   arrival gates    It uses such processed information to invoke other flight plan related tools  such as e g  Medium Term Conflict Detection  MTCD       Short term conflict alert  STCA  that checks possible conflicting trajectories in a time horizon of about two or three minutes  or even less in approach context     seconds in the French Roissy   Orly approach centres       Center TRACON automation system  CTAS   a suite of human centred decision support tools developed by NASA Ames Research Center   Several of the CTAS tools have been field tested and transitioned to the FAA for operational evaluation and use   Some of the CTAS tools are  traffic

Vietnam Air Traffic Management Corporation  VATM  Zambia   Zambia Civil Aviation Authority  ZCAA  Zimbabwe   Zimbabwe Civil Aviation Authority Proposed changes edit  In the United States  some alterations to traffic control procedures are being examined   Free flight is a developing air traffic control method that uses no centralised control  e g  air traffic controllers    Instead  parts of airspace are reserved dynamically and automatically in a distributed way using computer communication to ensure the required separation between aircraft      In Europe  the Single European Sky ATM Research  SESAR      programme plans to develop new methods  technologies  procedures  and systems to accommodate future       and beyond  air traffic needs   In October       European controller unions dismissed setting targets to improve ATC as  a waste of time and effort   as new technology could cut costs for users but threaten their jobs   In April       the EU called for a  Digital European Sky   focusing on cutting costs by including a common digitisation standard  and allowing controllers to move to where they are needed instead of merging national ATCs  as it would not solve all problems   Single air traffic control services in continent sized America and China does not alleviate congestion   Eurocontrol tries to reduce delays by diverting flights to less busy routes  flight paths across Europe were redesigned to accommodate the new airport in Istanbul  which opened in April  but the extra capacity will be absorbed by rising demand for air travel      Well paid jobs in western Europe could move east with cheaper labour   The average Spanish controller earn over          a year  over seven times the country average salary  more than pilots  and at least ten controllers were paid over               m  a year in        French controllers spent a cumulative nine months on strike between      and            Privatisation edit  Many countries have also privatised or corporatised their air navigation service providers       There are several models that can be used for ATC service providers   The first is to have the ATC services be part of a government agency as is currently the case in the United States   The problem with this model is that funding can be inconsistent  and can disrupt the development and operation of services   Sometimes funding can disappear when lawmakers cannot approve budgets in time   Both proponents and opponents of privatisation recognise that stable funding is one of the major factors for successful upgrades of ATC infrastructure   Some of the funding issues include sequestration and politicisation of projects       Proponents argue that moving ATC services to a private corporation could stabilise funding over the long term which will result in more predictable planning and rollout of new technology as well as training of personnel  As of November       The United States had     contractor towers that are staffed by private companies but administered by FAA through its FAA Contract Tower Program  which was established in       These contract control towers cover     of all the Federal air traffic control towers in the U S      Another model is to have ATC services provided by a government corporation   This model is used in Germany  where funding is obtained through user fees   Yet another model is to have a for profit corporation operate ATC services   This is the model used in the United Kingdom  but there have been several issues with the system there  including a large scale failure in December      which caused delays and cancellations and has been attributed to cost cutting measures put in place by this corporation   In fact  earlier that year  the corporation owned by the German government won the bid to provide ATC services for Gatwick Airport in the United Kingdom   The last model  which is often the suggested model for the United States to transition to is to have a non profit organisation that would handle ATC services as is used in Canada      The Canadian system is the one most often used as a model by proponents of privatisation   Air traffic control privatisation has been successful in Canada with the creation of Nav Canada  a private non profit organisation which has reduced costs  and has allowed new technologies to be deployed faster due to the elimination of much of the bureaucratic red tape   This has resulted in shorter flights and less fuel usage   It has also resulted in flights being safer due to new technology   Nav Canada is funded from fees that are collected from the airlines based on the weight of the aircraft and the distance flown      Air traffic control is operated by national governments with few exceptions  in the European Union  only Italy has private shareholders       Privatisation does not guarantee lower prices  the profit margin of MUAC was     in       as there is no competition  but governments could offer fixed terms concessions       ATC regulations in the United States edit  The United States airspace is divided into    zones  centres   and each zone is divided into sectors  Also within each zone are portions of airspace  about    miles     kilometres  in diameter  called TRACON  Terminal Radar Approach Control  airspaces  Within each TRACON airspace are a number of airports  each of which has its own airspace with a   miles      kilometres  radius  FAA control tower operators  CTO    air traffic controllers use FAA Order         as the authority for all procedures regarding air

from      revealed that the Calicut Airport was unsafe during wet weather landings  but still continued to allow it  which led to scrutiny after the crash of Air India Express Flight      in August           The report came after the crash of Air India Express Flight     in May      at Mangalore International Airport  which has a tabletop runway       Infrastructure Quality edit  Nationwide

and security  and cab scam incidents  which the AAI has consistently failed to address despite complaints and criticism      A      survey revealed that Chennai Airport has been rated Asia s worst airports for such reasons      The lack of proper planning and bureaucratic hurdles has been attributed for these issues  aside from older terminal buildings which have not been upgraded and refurbished or renovated with time      To counter these issues  new greenfield airports with modern amenities are being built  which will relieve passenger capacity overloads  give higher quality amenities  and improve punctuality       Overpriced Passenger Amenities edit  The AAI has been criticized for insufficient monitoring and regulation of passenger amenities and facilities such as food and drinks  that have been reportedly expensive      This has been notably rampant at privatized airports  which has led to frequent criticism by travelers and prominent figures      The high prices has been notably attributed to the high airport rentals  high revenue shares charged by private operators  cost of inventory  and employee salaries as only those with security clearances can be allowed to work      To solve this  the Government launched an affordable Udaan Yatri Cafe at various airports that provide meals and drinks at lower prices      The AAI has also faced scrutiny over other passenger services  especially Wi Fi service  As per officials of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India  airport Wi Fi service  which is constituted as public network  requires KYC  know your customer  details for security reasons  due to which Wi Fi access mandates use of PIN through Indian phone numbers      The restricted access has been condemned by travelers due to inconvenience  mostly to international passengers either visiting or transiting  limited timeframe to use for only    minutes  and unstable network      Despite criticism and negative reviews posted by travelers on Skytrax and Tripadvisor  the TRAI and AAI have consistently refused to change the rules citing safety reasons  which have affected ratings of both domestic and international airports nationwide when compared to other nations       References edit       Home   aai aero     a b https   sambandh msme gov in PPP AllCPSEs List aspx  bare URL     AAI Aero Board Member aai aero     Selection for the

Airport  which is much smaller in size and primarily handles regional and domestic flights to major metro cities out of the city under the UDAN Scheme      The former airport  which used to be the primary airport of NCR  Safdarjung Airport is now used mainly by VVIP helicopters and small charter helicopters due to its short runway  To offset the burgeoning traffic  the construction of a new airport  Noida International Airport  is currently underway        History edit  Lockheed Hudson Mark VI of No      Squadron RAF at RAF Station Palam Palam Airport was established by the British Raj as a base for the Royal Indian Air Force during World War II to support Allied military operations in Asia  After Indian Independence  the Royal Indian Air Force  which was later rechristened as the Indian Air Force  took over the airport      In       commercial passenger operations were relocated from Safdarjung Airport  Delhi s first airport  to Palam Airport  citation needed  At that time  Palam had a peak capacity of approximately       passengers per hour     In          a total of    lakh    million  domestic and international passengers flew into and out of Palam Airport      Owing to an increase in air traffic in the    s and    s  an additional terminal with nearly four times the area of the old Palam terminal was constructed  With the inauguration of this new international terminal  Terminal    on   May       the airport was renamed as Indira Gandhi International Airport  IGIA      The old domestic airport  Palam  is known as Terminal   and was divided into separate buildings    A   B  and  C  Blocks  A and  B were used to handle international operations while domestic operations took place in Block  C  Block  A and  B later became dedicated terminals for domestic airlines and are currently closed down  It is planned that they will be demolished after the construction of newer terminals  Block  C was also turned into a domestic arrivals terminal  and was rebuilt and opened on    February       The newly constructed domestic departures block  D is now used by domestic low cost airlines  IndiGo  and SpiceJet   There is also a separate technical area for VIP passengers  The domestic arrivals terminal  C was demolished and rebuilt into a brand new domestic arrivals terminal  For this expansion work  GoAir and select flights of IndiGo were moved to Terminal   as well as select flights of SpiceJet and IndiGo to Terminal    In October       Canada      commenced a flight to Toronto      This was the first nonstop service between India and North America      Russia s decision to open its airspace after the Cold War allowed the airline to save time by flying a direct route over the Arctic      Even though the    September attacks had precipitated a global decline in air travel  Canada      was hoping that the service would help it improve its financial position          Nevertheless  the company collapsed one month later      Significant growth in the Indian aviation industry led to a major increase in passenger traffic  The capacity of Terminal   was estimated to be      lakh       million  passengers per annum  mppa   The actual throughput for         was an estimated      crore       million  passengers  Including the then closed down international terminal  Terminal     the airport had a total capacity of      crore       million  passengers per year  whereas the total passenger traffic in         was      crore       million  passengers per year      In       the total passenger count at the airport reached     crore        million   To ease the traffic congestion on the existing terminals and in preparation for the      Commonwealth Games      a much larger Terminal   was constructed and inaugurated on   July           The new terminal s construction took    months for completion and this terminal increased the airport s total passenger capacity by    million      Apart from the two budget domestic airlines handled by Terminals   and    all other airlines operate their flights from Terminal    In June       Delhi International Airport became India s first to run entirely on Hydro Power and solar energy       Ownership edit  On    January       the aviation minister Praful Patel announced that the empowered Group of Ministers have agreed to sell the management rights of Delhi

British constructed the       metre long and    metre wide runway in the pre independence era and used it during World War II      In addition to Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow and Jaipur Airport in Jaipur  Delhi Airport is the only airport in India to have been equipped with the CAT III B ILS  as of           In the winter of       there were a record number of disruptions at Delhi Airport due to fog smog  Since then some domestic airlines have trained their pilots to operate under CAT II conditions of a minimum     m        ft  visibility  On    March       IGI became the first Indian airport to operate two runways simultaneously following a test run involving a SpiceJet plane landing on runway    and a Jet Airways plane taking off from runway    at the same time  The initially proposed mode involving simultaneous takeoffs in westerly flow to increase handling traffic capacity caused several near misses over the west side of the airport where the centrelines of runways       and      intersect      The runway use was changed to segregate dependent mode on    December       which was a few days after a near miss involving an Airbus A        of Qatar Airways and an IndiGo A    aircraft  The new method involved the use of runway    for all departures and runway    for all arrivals  This more streamlined model was adopted during day hours                     IST  until    September       On    August       the airport inaugurated its third runway    R   L  costing        crore     and       m         ft  long  The runway has one of the world s longest paved threshold displacements of       m        ft   This  in turn decreases the available landing length on runway   L to       m        ft   The reason for the long threshold displacement is due to the presence of a     m high Shiv statue  which is located near runway   L  dubious   discuss          The runway increased the airport s capacity to handle up to     flights from the previous       flights per hour  The new runway was opened for commercial operations on    September      and gradually began full round the clock operations by the end of October of the same year      Since       all three runways were operated simultaneously to handle traffic during day hours      Only runways   R   L and       are operated during night            IST  hours with single runway landing restriction during westerly traffic flow that is rotated late night       IST  and reversed weekly to distribute and mitigate night time landing noise over nearby residential areas      To cater for the demand of increasing air traffic  the master plan for the construction of a fourth parallel runway next to the existing runway   R   L was cleared in           along with the Eastern Cross Taxiways  ECT    a pair of elevated parallel taxiways linking the northern part of the airport with the southern runways  It will be elevated as it will pass over the airport approach roads  It will be     km      mi  long and both the taxiways will be    m      ft  wide  with a    m      ft  wide gap separating the taxiways  making it capable of handling Airbus A    and Boeing     type aircraft  It will help flights reducing duration to reach the southern runways from      minutes to only two minutes  as well as reducing pollution and traffic  The fourth runway and the ECT was inaugurated on    July                Terminals edit  Terminal  D at Indira Gandhi International Airport Inside view of Terminal   at Indira Gandhi International Airport IGI Airport serves as a major

the airport  equipping the airport with a night landing system comprising a Radio range and a modernised flare path lighting system      Construction of a new passenger terminal and apron began in      and was commissioned in          Named after the neighbourhood in which it stood and initially under the aegis of the Public Works Department  the new airport was subsequently run by the Ministry of Civil Aviation  With the dawning of the jumbo jet era in the     s  Santacruz  despite several extensions  began suffering from insufficient operational capacity  The Santacruz terminal was designed to accommodate     passengers at any given time  but by the late     s  it was handling        In            million domestic and international passengers flew into and out of Santa Cruz compared with   million at Delhi s Palam Airport  The airlines were constantly expanding their services  but there was no corresponding increase in space at the terminal  making it the most congested airport in the country  In one of its issues  Time magazine  referring to the chaos  called the terminal building a  black hole       A major fire gutted the International section of the terminal building on    September       killing three passengers and shutting down the airport  A temporary departure extension or  Gulf Terminal  was made functional in October of that year until the terminal was repaired      The Tata committee  set up in      to examine the issues concerning the airport  had recommended the construction of a new international terminal to meet the requirements of traffic in the seventies  The Santa Cruz terminal was to be used for domestic traffic alone  The International Airport Authority of India  IAAI   which was set up in       started planning the construction of a new terminal building for handling international passenger traffic  to be completed by       Accordingly  construction of the new international terminal at Sahar to the northeast of Santacruz in Vile Parle was taken up at an estimated cost of       million  Construction of the new international terminal at Sahar began in November       and the first phase took three years to build  Sahar Terminal  A  the first phase of the two part terminal  was opened on   December           AAI had been considering the modernisation of Bombay Airport in       although the AAI board approved a modernisation proposal only in       By then  Bombay and Delhi Airports were handling     of the country s aircraft movements and generating one third of all revenues earned by AAI  At that time  the Bombay airport handled      million passengers      of whom were domestic travellers  The airport faced severe congestion for both aircraft and passengers as it was handling twice as many aircraft movements per day as it was originally designed for  The bidding process for its modernisation eventually began in May       with the decision by the Empowered Group of Ministers  EGoM  was announced in January           In November       Delta Air Lines inaugurated a direct flight from Mumbai to New York          In January       the International Terminal  A was demolished to make way for the new terminal      The new Terminal was inaugurated   years later in January           although it was open to passenger operations the following month  Terminals  B and  C were subsequently demolished by the end of       Terminal   subsequently started domestic operations in       with Vistara launching flights to Delhi      A new Air Traffic Control tower was also inaugurated  which replaced the old tower until       During the lockdown in COVID    pandemic starting March       commercial operations were suspended  although rescue flights to bring back expat Indians were in effect  operated by Air India and Air India Express      Passengers arriving had to undergo mandatory testing and quarantine period      The Adani Group took over the operations in February      from GVK  The group holds a     stake  while the rest is controlled by Airports Authority of India      In       MIAL proposed to increase CSMIA s capactiy from from    MPA to    MPA  The existing Terminal   building  with a capacity of    MPA was proposed to be re constructed to handle    MPA at a cost of about Rs       crore  The project is estimated to be completed in three years with demolition activity planned to begin in November      and construction planned to be completed by September       T  would be expanded to handle    MPA from the current    MPA  MIAL proposed construction of about        square metres of additional floor space at a cost of Rs       crore  The Northwest pier is proposed to be extended in order to accommodate a dedicated crew terminal at T   This will free up space for passengers at T   since nearly      air crew who board flights daily have to use the common passenger areas  The dedicated crew terminal will cover about       square metres and is expected to cost Rs    crore  The extended pier will also have extra bus and contact gates  MIAL expects the crew terminal to be ready by      The existing general aviation  GA  terminal is also to be expanded at a cost of Rs     crore  from current floor area of     square metres to        square metres        Passenger and air traffic edit  Its passenger traffic was about      million in year       It is also the second busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic  In March       the airport surpassed London s Gatwick Airport as the world s busiest to operate a single runway at a time  This was later surpassed again by Gatwick Airport at the end of      due to passenger numbers falling at Mumbai      It handled a record of       aircraft movements on   December       higher than its earlier record of       flight movements in a day in June       It handled a record of    movements in one hour on    September           In financial year       the airport handled       million passengers  only second to IGI s      million in India      In financial year          the airport handled the highest ever passengers in its history of over      million passengers  surpassing its maximum capacity of    million passengers per year  and second only to IGI s      million in India      Ownership edit  A consortium of GVK Industries  Airports Company South Africa  and Bidvest      won the bid to run the Mumbai Airport  To accomplish this task  Mumbai International Airport Private Limited  MIAL   a joint venture between the consortium       and the Airports Authority of India       was formed      Since then  MIAL has made several improvements in the aesthetics  design and passenger conveniences at CSMIA including the refurbishment of domestic terminals  A    B  international terminals  B    C  and the opening of a brand new domestic terminal  C and new Terminal T   MIAL also undertook airside improvement projects such as the commissioning of new taxiways  and aprons and the reconstruction of the two runways      In February       MIAL entered into an agreement with Air Transport IT specialist SITA that led to CSIA becoming the first airport in India to Implement Common use self service Kiosks and CUTE  Common Use Terminal Equipment  check in systems      In February       the Adani Group  through its subsidiary  Adani Enterprises acquired both GVK and Bidvest s stakes in MIAL  giving it a controlling interest of     in the venture           Structure edit  Runways edit  The airport has two intersecting runways and handles an average of     flights per day      The runways were upgraded to Code F  which means they can accommodate larger aircraft like the Airbus A             Following a presentation in March      by UK s air traffic service provider NATS     on how the capacity of the airport can be increased  MIAL set a target of    aircraft movements an hour in an effort to reduce congestion at the airport  Both runways were operated simultaneously especially during peak hours to try and attain this target      MIAL scrapped simultaneous Cross runway flight operations in mid      after it found that single runway operations were more effective for increasing aircraft movements per hour  Runway       was henceforth to be used only when the main runway was unavailable due to maintenance or other reasons      The construction of new rapid exit taxiways helped in increasing flight handling capacity from    movements per hour to    in           NATS delivered and helped MIAL implement a  change roadmap  to help CSMIA achieve more than    movements per hour in           The increased air side efficiencies resulted in CSMIA overtaking Gatwick Airport in March      to become the world s busiest airport with only one operational runway at a time         Number  Length

reconstructed in       The runway shoulders were widened from     to    metres     to    ft       The associated taxiways of the secondary runway were upgraded in       A new rapid exit taxiway and the conversion of taxiways to Code F effectively increased the capacity of the runway  In       the secondary runway set a record of    movements per hour during peak hour traffic as compared to

critical situations such as emergency landings or during wet conditions  which has led to aircraft skidding on landing  The shorter length of the runway affects widebody planes in such scenarios  MIAL was considering constructing a second parallel runway as part of its master plan  However  the construction of this runway would necessitate a large scale relocation of either Air India s hangars and maintenance facilities or the airport s flight kitchens and the Sahar police station  among others  depending on its alignment  The parallel runway remains an active part of the expansion plan but in the meantime the cross runway is being upgraded as much as possible       The ATC tower as seen from the Western Express Highway Air traffic control tower edit  India s second tallest air traffic

took over operations on   January           From the new tower  air traffic controllers are able to see   km    miles  beyond the thresholds of both runways  The tower and its associated technical block and mechanical plant building cover a total of       m          sq ft       The cost of the fully equipped tower is estimated at    billion          The previous ATC tower  built by the Airports Authority of India  AAI  at an overall project cost of about       billion  was functional from      to           During that period  many airlines such as Singapore Airlines  Saudia  Qantas and United avoided landing at Mumbai airport when the secondary runway was in use as the ATC tower was too close to the runway and not in compliance with ICAO standards  The tower penetrated runway       s transitional obstacle limitation surfaces by over    metres  for ILS approaches           The tower also obstructed the path of a parallel taxiway under construction for the secondary runway      MIAL demolished the tower in            Terminals edit  The airport has two terminals for scheduled commercial passenger services  Terminal   at Santacruz for domestic flights and Terminal   at Sahar for both international and domestic flights  While both terminals use the same airside facilities  they are physically separated on the city side  requiring a       minute  landside  drive between them  A dedicated General Aviation Terminal caters to passengers using private and non scheduled flight operations   Currently operational terminals edit  Terminal   edit  Departure hall in Terminal   Terminal    locally known as Santacruz Airport  is used for domestic flights primarily operated by low cost carriers  This was the original Santacruz building that was Mumbai s first passenger terminal which was once integrated  however was renamed Terminal   after the opening of the Sahar building for international operations and became a domestic operations terminal  It was refurbished several times over the decades  the most recent being during the     s  It was further divided into Terminal  A  Terminal  B  and Terminal  C after their permanent closure during the course of the late     s and early     s  It was used by SpiceJet  Go First  and IndiGo  but after Jet Airways dissolved on    April       select flights from all the Terminal   airlines moved into the newer Terminal   building      The terminal has    passenger boarding bridges  MIAL renamed Terminal  B to Terminal   in January      to help fliers identify it easily      Citing safety and structural challenges  in March       the Adani Group announced plans to demolish and re build Terminal    a few months after the airport in Navi Mumbai starts operations  The rebuilding project was to begin in November      and the upgraded terminal was expected to be operational by                  However in August       Adani said that the terminal s closure and demolition would be delayed and instead be coordinated with the commencement of operations at NMIA s second terminal      The New Terminal   will be connected to Terminal   through a three lane underground tunnel to facilitate airside passenger movement between terminals  The tunnel will cost Rs           Crores and will be completed in   phases       Terminal   edit  Entrance of Terminal   building Terminal   as seen from Sahar

Old International Terminal was closed permanently at       on    February       and international operations from the New Terminal   commenced on the same day      The first arrival was Air India flight      an Airbus A         from Singapore via Chennai  and the first departure was Jet Airways flight      a Boeing        ER  to London  It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh      The domestic operations at Terminal   were launched on   January       with the inaugural flight of Vistara arriving from New Delhi      Vistara initially operated from Level   of the Terminal  which is being used only by international passengers  but in July       they shifted to Level    which will be used only for domestic operations          Air India shifted all of its domestic operations from Terminal  A to Terminal   on   October      making it the second airline to operate domestic flights from the Terminal    to ease their International and Domestic passenger transfers                  and Jet Airways shifted all of its domestic operations from Terminal   to Terminal   on    March       facilitating a seamless transfer experience for its passengers      whereas all other domestic airlines  namely Indigo  Go First  and SpiceJet  took place  both Departure and Arrival  at Terminal        After the demise of Jet Airways on    April       other carriers launched additional domestic flights using slots vacated by Jet Airways  These flights were operated from Terminal        This arrangement resulted in some of the larger carriers having to operate domestic flights from both terminals  Hence  MIAL moved to streamline operations at both terminals in September       shifting all of its domestic operations of Indigo  AirAsia India and Go First back to Terminal    while SpiceJet shifted all of its domestic operations from Terminal   to Terminal        Until          the security of the airport was under Maharashtra Police Mumbai Police  However  following the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight     on    December      and September    attacks in the United States in       airport security was handed to the Airport Sector division of the Central Industrial Security Force in July               The airport has free Wi Fi connectivity provided by Tata Docomo across both Terminal   and    However  the service has faced severe criticism for being ineffective and complicated access for international passengers  as the passengers need to get an OTP through an Indian phone number only  while the free service lasts for just    minutes  following which passengers have to buy data packs      The phone number requirement has been attributed to the requirements of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India for safety considerations      Following frequent criticism  Wi Fi kiosks were installed for passengers who do not have a local phone number  which can issue coupons after scanning boarding passes and passports and provide   hour

The airport s General Aviation  GA  Terminal for private and non scheduled flight operators  NSOPs  is located at Kalina on the southwest side of the airfield      The terminal was approved for international operations in April           making CSMIA the first airport in India     to have a self contained terminal for handling round the clock domestic and international flight operations for private and NSOPs  The terminal offers facilities for passengers departing and arriving on private aircraft and business jets  The terminal has two exclusive lounges  two conference halls  two crew restrooms and a caf  bar      It has parking for    general aviation aircraft  Once the new airport at Navi Mumbai is opened  most of the business jets  turboprops and charter aircraft parked at CSMIA will be moved to the general aviation bays and hangars of NMIA by the end of       CSMIA will continue to be accessible to charter and private aircraft flyers as general aviation movement is not being banned  However  visiting GA aircraft will take off for some other airport after dropping off its passengers      MIAL  in its      submission to the Government  said that the existing GA terminal was not sufficient to handle GA traffic  In FY     CSMIA handled        GA aircraft movements and the next fiscal this number rose to        or an average daily    movements  Mumbai s corporate houses tend to use larger chartered aircraft of     seating capacity and these and other international GA passengers were currently being handled via T   The existing general aviation  GA  terminal is to be expanded at a cost of Rs     crore  from current floor area of     square metres to        square metres  MIAL proposed to have an integrated terminal for handling both domestic as well as international passengers without mixing of passengers       Previous terminals edit  Terminal    divided into  A   B  and  C  edit  When the Sahar terminal was opened in the     s  the terminal at Santacruz reverted to being a domestic terminal  The terminal consisted of three structures  Terminals  A   B  and  C   Terminal  A   It was opened in April       and was used solely by Indian Airlines  now Air India   In       Kingfisher Airlines also began operating from  A  after it entered into an agreement to source all ground handling and terminal space from Indian Airlines      In June       shortly after Kingfisher ceased operations  MIAL allocated the vacant space to GoAir      From   October       Air India moved all of its Terminal  A operations to the new Terminal    GoAir moved its departure operations to Terminal  B on that same date  resulting in the closure of the Terminal  A departures level  GoAir  however  continued to use Terminal  A s arrivals level     until    March      when its arrivals were also shifted to Terminal  B     and Terminal  A was shut  Terminal  B   It was opened in       and This was the original Santacruz building that was Mumbai s first passenger terminal which was once integrated  however was renamed Terminal   after the opening of the Sahar building for international operations and became a domestic operations terminal  Terminal  C   It was built at a cost of     billion and opened in April       Architectural design was provided by Hafeez Contractor  EDRC  the in house design unit of the EPC contractor Larsen   Toubro  L T  performed the Structural  MEP and IT Airport systems design  The terminal had six passenger boarding bridges and allowed connectivity between Terminals  A and  B  It was spread over         sq ft across three levels and had a seating capacity of about     passengers  Level   housed the offices of MIAL and some airlines  Level   comprised the security hold area for passengers after checking in at either Terminal  A or  B  Level   accommodated a food court      The building served as a boarding only facility for all airlines  Passengers entered this facility via Terminal  B  In January       MIAL renamed the Terminal  B as T        Terminal    divided into  A   B  and  C  edit  Terminal  B and  C as seen from the runway before being decommissioned and demolished Terminal   of the airport

capacity of     million annual passengers  This terminal had an area of         m             sq ft      The terminal structure was laid out in a space saving vertical arrangement with separate levels for arrivals and departures  An overpass on the city side took passengers to the upper level departure forecourt      The original terminal was a convex shaped single concourse building with    Code E contact stands  The greater T  apron also provided a further    Code D E and   Code C remote stands  This gave a total of    stands on the existing apron      The departures section of  A had    check in counters     more than in the international section at the Santacruz terminal  After completing customs and immigration formalities  the departing travellers were led down to a mezzanine floor where five elongated nodules connect the terminal with the aircraft via aerobridges       Terminal  A   This first phase of the terminal complex was completed at a cost of      million  US     million     and it served most international carriers  Its boarding gates   to   were the first aerobridges installed in the subcontinent  It was decommissioned and demolished in January          to make way for the new T  structure  Terminal  B   It cost      million  US     million  and was completed in          It served Air India and carriers handled by Air India between September      and October      and was decommissioned when Terminal  C opened  It was extensively refurbished and made operational once again following the demolition of Terminal  A  Terminal  C   Inaugurated in October       it was originally and exclusively for Air India  Air India Express and those carriers whose ground operations were handled by Air India  Terminals  B and  C were decommissioned in February      when the new T  took over operations  They were demolished later that year so that the remainder of the new T  could be completed       Cargo Complex edit  The Air Cargo Complex  located west of the International Passenger Terminal    has been in operation since           The cargo apron is capable of handling five wide bodied aircraft  In          the airport handled         metric tonnes of

airport  The panel decided on Devanahalli  a village about    kilometres     mi  north of Bengaluru          The State Government drafted a proposal to build the airport with private assistance  which the Union Government approved in           In       the Airports Authority of India  AAI  and the Government of Karnataka decided to call for international consortia to own  build and operate the new greenfield airport      In December       a consortium made up of the Tata Group  Raytheon and Singapore Changi Airport signed a memorandum of understanding  MoU  with the State Government regarding participation in the project  In June       however  the consortium announced it was pulling out of the project due to delays in government approval  These included disputes over the location of the new airport and the fate of HAL Airport          In May       the Airports Authority of India  AAI  and the Karnataka State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation  KSIIDC  signed a memorandum of understanding  MoU  regarding the project  It would be a public private partnership  with AAI and KSIIDC holding a     share and private companies holding the remaining          In January       the State Government created the company Bengaluru International Airport Limited  BIAL  as a special purpose entity  and began searching for partners      By November  the project had attracted Z rich Airport  Siemens Project Ventures and Larsen   Toubro      Construction was expected to begin in October           however  governmental delays persisted          The Union Cabinet approved the project in February           The concession agreement between the State Government  the Union Government and BIAL was signed in July       and it required the closure of HAL Airport          It took nearly a decade to progress from the initial stages of land allocation and acquisition  to the signing of shareholder agreements in      and the start of construction       Design When the project was initiated  BIAL anticipated traffic of approximately   million passengers per annum in the first few years of operations  However  the scale of air traffic growth in the city meant that the figure was already breached by       It took more than   months to redesign the project and gain permission for expansion  By the time the approvals for the reworked project were sanctioned  construction was half completed  Despite the challenges  BIAL expected the airport to be operational by the initially proposed date of completion      The revised increase in capacity catered to    million passengers per annum  more than doubling the previous estimates  BIAL s modified plan was to build a terminal with   passenger boarding bridges    double arm aerobridge    remote bus gates and a single        metres         ft  long runway  BIAL also planned to build an apron with    Code C aircraft stands  with   contact stands   as well as an air and land side road system  The estimated cost for the entire project at the time was        crore  US     million        Construction and opening             Construction commenced on   July       and was completed in    months  BIAL set the launch date for    March               However  due to delays in establishing air traffic control services at the airport  the launch date was pushed to    May      and further to    May           Public criticism arose with the opening of the new airport  mainly due to the closure of HAL Airport  In March       AAI employees initiated a massive strike against the closure of HAL Airport in Bengaluru and Begumpet Airport in Hyderabad  fearing they would lose their jobs      The Bangalore City Connect Foundation  a group of citizens and businessmen  staged a rally in mid May  claiming the new airport was too small for the latest demand projections          On    May  a hearing was held at the Karnataka High Court over poor connectivity between the city and the airport  Ultimately  the State Government decided to go ahead with inaugurating the new airport and closing HAL Airport      The first commercial flight  Air India Flight      AI     from Mumbai  was allowed to land at      PM on    May      the day before the official inauguration  as it would be continuing to Singapore shortly after midnight  The airport became the third greenfield airport to open under a public

 Southeast Asia and the Middle Eastern cities of Dubai  Doha and Abu Dhabi    History edit  Subhas Chandra Bose at the airport in      Early history edit  Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport was founded in the early     s as the Calcutta Aerodrome     The airport traditionally served as a strategic stopover on the air route from North America and Europe to Indochina and Australia  citation needed  Dakota   was the first aircraft to land in the airport     In       KLM began scheduled stops at Calcutta  as part of their Amsterdam to Batavia  Jakarta  route           The same year  a Royal Air Force aircraft landed in Calcutta as part of the first round the world expedition by any air force              The airport began as an open ground next to the Royal Artillery Armoury in Dum Dum                  Sir Stanley Jackson  Governor of Bengal  opened the Bengal Flying Club at Dum Dum Calcutta aerodrome in February           In       the airfield was made fit for use throughout the year      and other airlines began to utilise the airport  Air Orient began scheduled stops as part of a Paris to Saigon route     and Imperial Airways began flights from London to Australia via Calcutta in       thus drew many airlines to Calcutta Airport             Many pioneering flights passed through the airport  including Amelia Earhart s in                   Calcutta played an important role in the Second World War  In       the United States Army Air Forces  th Bombardment Group flew B    Liberator bombers from the airport on combat missions over Burma  The airfield was used as a cargo aerial port for the Air Transport Command and was also used as a communication centre for the Tenth Air Force           Post independence edit  Nepal Airlines at Dum Dum Airport in      Scandinavian Airlines is one of the many European airlines that used to operate to Kolkata at one point  Seen here is their inaugural flight to Kolkata  Passenger services grew after the Second World War  Calcutta became a destination for the world s first jet powered passenger aircraft  the de Havilland Comet  on a British Overseas Airways Corporation  BOAC  route to London              Furthermore  in      Indian Airlines introduced the first Indian domestic jet service  using Caravelle jets on the Calcutta Delhi route      Between the     s and     s  the airport was served by several major airlines including Aeroflot      Air France      Alitalia      Cathay Pacific      Japan Airlines      Philippine Airlines      KLM      Lufthansa      Pan Am      Qantas      Swissair      and SAS      Due to the introduction of longer haul aircraft and the poor political climate of Calcutta during the     s and also during the year       several airlines discontinued their service to the airport  The      Bangladesh Liberation War saw a large increase of both refugees and disease in Calcutta  causing more airlines to cease services to the city  In       the airport opened the first dedicated cargo terminal in India  The     s saw new growth for Calcutta Airport  as the Indian aviation industry saw the arrival of new airlines such as Jet Airways and Air Sahara  A new domestic terminal named Terminal   was opened in      making the international one Terminal    and the airport was renamed in honour of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose  In       a new international arrival hall was opened          Modernisation edit  Check in area of the integrated terminal Departure hall of the integrated terminal Exterior of the new integrated terminal      saw the growth of low cost carriers in the Indian aviation sector  with new airlines including SpiceJet  IndiGo  and Kingfisher Airlines  This led to a dramatic rise in passenger numbers at the airport  Overcrowding in both terminals led to the implementation of a comprehensive modernisation plan for the airport               Panoramic view of the departures area of Terminal   at NSCBIA  Kolkata        Domestic terminal Work included an expansion of runway   L   R  rapid exit taxiways and parking bays  The runway was extended by     metres       mi        metres to      metres  on the northern side and       feet      m  on the southern side and was fitted with CAT I facilities for night use  A     year old mosque that lies    metres from the runway  northern end prohibits further expansion in this direction      The longer runway    R   L  was upgraded from CAT I to CAT II ILS status to allow landings in poor visibility  In August       it was announced that the instrument landing system of the primary runway would be upgraded to CAT IIIb  This allows flights to operate till visibility drops below    metres  The secondary runway would be upgraded to CAT II  The      crore  equivalent to      crore or US    million in       upgrading work started in February              and was completed in January           The modernisation plan included some improvements of the airport s existing terminals  including the addition of extra ticketing counters  check in kiosks  and cafes to the domestic terminal in       However  the need to replace the airport s terminals entirely led to plans for a new integrated terminal  known as T  to differentiate it from the older domestic block  to serve both international and domestic destinations  A Thai based company  the Italian Thai Development  ITD  Corporation  ITD ITDCem JV  a consortium of ITD and ITD Cementation  and the     year old iconic Project Management Consultant Parsons Brinckerhoff  PB  was hired with Delhi based designer Sikka Associates Architects to construct the building  Construction commenced in November       and T  was inaugurated on    January      after overshooting the previous deadlines of July      and August               The former airport hotel  Ashok  was demolished to give way for two new five star luxury hotels and a shopping mall in its place          Commercial operations were intended to start on    January       the    th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose      However  the shift to the new terminal was only completed on    March           Airports Council International named it the best improved airport in the Asia Pacific region in      and                        Infrastructure edit  Runways edit  Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport has two parallel runways  the primary runway   R   L has a capacity of approximately    flights per hour and the secondary runway   L   R has a capacity of    flights per hour  The secondary runway is usually used as a taxiway when the main runway is used  When the primary runway is shut down for maintenance purposes  the secondary runway is used            Runways at NSCBI Airport

services edit  Air India operates hangars at the airport  while Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil act as fuellers  Catering facilities are owned by Taj Sats and Oberoi Flight Services           Terminals edit  The ceiling of the new integrated terminal is adorned with works by Rabindranath Tagore       The airport s new integrated terminal T  is spread over         m             sq ft  and can handle    million passengers annually  compared to the previous terminal T  s capacity of five million  The terminal is an L shaped structure  containing six levels  It contains     check in counters that utilise CUTE  Common User Terminal Equipment  technology and has    immigration counters and twelve customs counters      Passenger lounges are provided by Air India  The terminal is equipped with    aerobridges and a further    remote parking bays  There are plans to construct an    foot bronze statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in the integrated terminal complex          Kolkata s old international and domestic terminals closed permanently when the integrated terminal opened  However  there were plans to renovate the old international terminal to be used for future hajj services  while the domestic terminal could be used by regional airlines  An earlier proposal of continuing low cost carrier operations from the existing domestic terminal has been shelved due to the need to fully utilise the new integrated terminal s capacity  making it the first airport in India to shift even its low cost domestic airlines to the new integrated building upon completion              However  the old terminal will be replaced by a new terminal T  to increase the overall capacity      In the financial year from April      to March       Kolkata Airport served      million passengers      of which traveled domestically      The withdrawal of Lufthansa s service to Frankfurt in March      left Kolkata with no direct connections beyond Asia      However  other international operations increased in           The new terminal has attracted some airlines to expand their route networks to include Kolkata          In September       the Airports Authority of India upgraded the airport s cargo handling capacity  enabling it to cater for the demand until          There has been a    per cent growth in international cargo movement to and from Kolkata Airport and a    per cent increase in outward transit  Automobile parts accounted for the bulk of the growth in the movement of cargo from the city to other countries  In November      the first Centre for Perishable Cargo  CPC  in West Bengal was opened at the airport  The CPC has an area of       m         sq ft  and an annual storage capacity of        million tonnes  The CPC had been undergoing trials that started in June      and were built with a       crore  equivalent to      crore or US         in       grant in aid from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority  APEDA  part of the Commerce Ministry      The volume of export was        tonnes in          during the current fiscal more than        tonnes of cargo were handled by the airport  Similarly  the volume of import cargo increased from        tonnes to        tonnes  increasing over ten per cent during the same period  However  in         the total volume of cargo handled by the airport declined by      from the previous year  On   June       Singapore Airlines operated the Airport s first Airbus A    service from Singapore to Kolkata  enhancing the weekly seat capacity       Expansion edit  Airside ATC complex of NSCBIA  A new     m tall control tower is currently under construction  Bird s eye view of the integrated terminal Airside of NSCBIA  Kolkata at night The construction of terminal T   as well as runway expansion  marked the end of Phase   of the project  AAI officials have announced that they are prepared to execute Phase   of the Kolkata Airport expansion plan  This involves the construction of a new ATC Tower to provide controllers with a better view of the planes at the new terminal  The building will be accompanied by a   storey office complex          Initially  a     meter tower was proposed  but the height has been revised multiple times and in      it was decreased to      meter      The under construction tower is expected to be complete by late      and will replace the older one constructed in           By July       the construction of the ATC was completed though the installation of all necessary equipment was due       New expansion plan edit  The new terminal T  inaugurated in      is on the verge of reaching its annual capacity of    million passengers four years ahead of the initial projections  To tackle this  AAI has planned to upgrade and expand the airport and increase its passenger capacity by construction of another terminal T  to handle up to    million passengers annually  The new terminal will come up north of the current integrated terminal T   The new        crore expansion plan will be carried out in two phases over a span of six years  The number of parking bays will be increased to     by       Additionally the existing terminal is undergoing an interim expansion of      crore that will see the terminal handle an additional   million passengers annually  bringing the total handling capacity of the existing terminal to    million passengers annually                   Phase   edit  Airport officials said as per the first phase of the expansion plan  the old domestic terminal T  will be demolished and a       m       acres  new building will be constructed in the area  The building will be linked with the existing terminal of the airport with the help of walkalators and would also have walk in gates on the ground floor  This building will be used only for boarding and de boarding of passengers  Passengers arriving in the boarding building would take the connecting bridge to the terminal and then leave the airport  This would reduce peak hour congestion when several flights do not get enough apron space  This would immediately increase the passenger capacity by a few million and would solve the space crunch for the time being          The new building will be U shaped where the rectangular section  the location of parking lot of old terminal  will host the check in counters  security check portals and baggage handling facilities  The two arms  one each at the northern and southern end  will function as concourse and will host operational area  house boarding gates and aerobridges  The rectangular section and southern arm will be built as part of the phase    The phase   expansion plan has been sanctioned by AAI       Phase   edit  The phase   of the is yet to receive approval from the aviation ministry as of       In this phase  the old Air Traffic Navigation Building will be demolished to make way for the northern concourse of the new terminal as mentioned above  The construction of new hangars and bays is also part of the current expansion plan               Airlines and destinations edit  Passenger edit  AirlinesDestinations Air Arabia  Abu

airport serving Panaji  the capital of the state of Goa  India  It is operated by the Airports Authority of India  AAI  as a civil enclave in an Indian Navy naval airbase named INS Hansa  The airport is located in Dabolim  in South Goa district    km      mi  from the nearest city of Vasco da Gama     km     mi  from Margao  and about    km     mi  from the state capital  Panaji     The airport s integrated terminal was inaugurated in December       It was designed by Creative Group  an India based architecture firm  In fiscal year          the airport handled over     million passengers     Since fiscal year          the airport has been witnessing decline in passenger  air and cargo traffic  due to the excess traffic taken by the new airport as the second airport of the state     Several European charter airlines fly to Goa seasonally  typically between November and May  Until       flights from the UK  London Gatwick Airport and Manchester Airport  were operated by TUI Airways and Air India  which operated on a daily basis  before both the airlines shifted to the new airport in      to relieve the growing excess traffic in this airport        As of       there are also several seasonal charter flights to various Russian cities  Because of capacity constraints at the terminal and air traffic congestion due to the military and naval presence  a second airport at Mopa was proposed  It completed its construction on    December       with operations starting from   January                  It is located approximately    km     mi  from Dabolim Airport    History edit  The airport was built in      by the Government of the Portuguese State of India  on     acres      ha  of land  as the Aeroporto de Dabolim  which was later officially renamed Aeroporto General B nard Guedes      Until       the airport served as the main hub of the Portuguese India s airline TAIP  Transportes A reos da  ndia Portuguesa   which on a regular schedule served Daman  Diu  Karachi  Mozambique  Portuguese Timor  and other destinations  During the Annexation of Goa  in December       the airport was bombarded by the Indian Air Force with parts of the infrastructure being destroyed  Two civilian planes that were in the airport   a Lockheed Constellation from TAP  Transportes A reos Portugueses  and a Douglas DC   from TAIP   managed to escape with refugees  during the night  to Karachi      In April       it was occupied by the Indian Navy s air wing when Major General K  P  Candeth  who had led the successful military operation into Goa   handed over  the airport to the Indian Navy before relinquishing charge as its military governor to a Lieutenant Governor of the then Union Territory of Goa  Daman and Diu in June       For civilian air travel out of Vasco da Gama and Goa  the Indian Navy and the Government of India invited the public sector airline  known now as Indian  to operate at Dabolim from      after the runway was repaired and jet enabled  A new domestic terminal building was built in       designed to process     arrivals and departures simultaneously  while the international terminal  built in      was designed for      Once two vital road bridges across the main waterways of Goa were built in the early     s  and Goa hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting  CHOGM  in       the charter flight business began to take off at Dabolim a few years later  pioneered by Condor Airlines of Germany      In       the Indian Civil Aviation Ministry announced a plan to upgrade Dabolim Airport  This involved constructing a new international passenger terminal  after converting the existing one to domestic  and adding several more aircraft stands over an area of about   hectares      acres   The construction was scheduled to be completed by the end of           However delays in transfer of the required land from the Navy held up proceedings  The modernisation project of Dabolim Airport was one of    airport expansion projects undertaken by the AAI and  in terms of size and money  was its third largest project after the ones at Chennai and Kolkata airports      It included the construction of an integrated terminal building to replace the older terminals  a multi level car parking  MLCP  facility to accommodate between     and     cars and construction of additional parking stands for aircraft  The AAI acquired additional land from the Indian Navy and the State Government for apron expansion and the expansion of the older international terminal building complex      The foundation stone for the terminal was laid on    February       the project work began in May      and construction of the terminal began in May           The terminal can handle       peak hour passengers  cost       billion and was inaugurated on   December           Due to rising passenger traffic  restrictions over the airport on night flights by the Navy and no scope to expand the airport due to space and navy limitations  an alternative airport  Manohar International Airport  has been built at Mopa  North Goa district      It has been built specially to help relieve the growing pressure on Dabolim Airport and to connect the state of Goa and its adjoining regions with more international destinations to increase tourism  It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on    December      and flight operations began on   January               The new airport has already connected many domestic destinations  which previously did not have any connection s with Goa  To carry international traffic to and from the new airport  some airlines like Aeroflot  Oman Air and TUI Airways will shift their operations from Dabolim Airport by the end of       Air India shifted its London flights to the new airport  which is at present the only regular European destination from Goa  on    July       thus making it the first international airline to operate to and from the new airport                   Economic factors edit  Model of the new integrated terminal building on display Departure area at Dabolim Airport Waiting hall on the second floor of the old terminal Apron view Dabolim s air traffic control is in the hands of the Indian Navy  which earns revenues from this service on account of aircraft movements  Landing fees are of the order of          US      each while Route Navigation Facility  RNF  Charges are about         US      The Airports Authority of India could be eligible for aircraft parking fees of          US      per day  It receives a part of the passenger service fee which is shared between it and the Central Industrial Security Force  CISF   The AAI s prime source of earning is from non traffic services like passenger facilitation  car park  entry tickets  stalls  restaurants  and shops at the main terminal building and advertising boards  Capital expenditures  such as for runway expansion  at the airport are covered by AAI  The Dabolim Airport runway has increased from about       feet        m  initially to        feet        m  as of April          and can accommodate Boeing    s  There is a shortage of night parking bays which are at a premium in metro airports like Mumbai  A local association has estimated that about    hectares are needed for the civil enclave in comparison to the    hectares earmarked at present       Facilities edit  Structure edit  The airport is spread over     hectares        acres   and possibly     hectares or       acres clarification needed   and consists of a civil enclave of nearly    hectares     acres   an increase from its original size of   hectares     acres   The civil enclave is operated by the AAI  Of the     flights daily      there is a very large concentration of civilian traffic in the period between      pm and      pm during weekdays  with the balance in the early morning hours  This is because of naval restrictions for military flight training purposes throughout the year  In September       the AAI and the Indian Navy entered into a Memorandum of understanding  MoU  to construct a full length  parallel taxi track suitable for Boeing     type of aircraft and agreed to share the cost of construction      The environmental clearance for the project was received in January       The project  which involved development of a       metre long parallel taxi track along with associated facilities  would be completed in three phases      The first phase was completed by November           The completed taxiway was opened in December       It raised the capacity of the runway from    air traffic movements  ATMs  per hour to       ATMs per hour      The Navy s premises straddle the Dabolim runway and consequently its personnel would cross the runway at one point  on foot or bicycles or in vehicles  between flights  As part of the works taken up in       a peripheral road was built and the local traffic would no longer affect flight movement       Terminal edit  The airport s integrated terminal building handles both international and domestic passengers  It was opened in December       The building design features aesthetic glass  large steel span structures  and frameless glazing  The        square metre terminal is designed to cater to five million passengers annually  It is equipped with eight aerobridges  The terminal features an in line baggage scanning system and a state of the art sewage treatment plant      It has    check in counters     immigration counters for departures     immigration counters for arrivals     security check booths  and eight customs counters  The basement of the four level terminal has utilities like electricity and cargo handling  The check in counters are placed on the ground floor while the first floor has security check booths  The second floor has the security hold area where passengers may wait before boarding an aircraft  The old terminal buildings were closed after the commissioning of the new terminal       Airlines and

The airport director has claimed that     million passengers used the airport in CY       This rose to about     million in CY       The airport is ranked among the top ten in the country in terms of passenger traffic  Airport authorities consider that it has been operating at saturation levels since       Today  Goa s estimated      international flights per year account for some     of India s international charter tourist flights  It is estimated that about     to     thousand international tourists arrive at Dabolim on charter flights  Goa s total international tourists  roughly double the charter passengers  account for       of the national figure and        of the country s foreign exchange receipts from tourism  As the weekend morning hours approach saturation due to waves of chartered flights especially from the United Kingdom and Russia  attention is shifting to the night and early morning hours of weekdays for accommodating such flights  Tourists from UK to Goa by air were estimated to number about         in         while those from Russia numbered about         by     charter flights  in the same period  citation needed   Naval station at Dabolim edit  Main article  INS Hansa INS Hansa is India s biggest naval airbase      The air station of the Indian Navy at Dabolim was transferred here from the Sulur Air Force Base in Coimbatore after the liberation of Goa from colonial Portuguese rule in December       In       the Indian Navy began inducting the BAE Sea Harrier into service  basing training activities at Dabolim  The Harriers were replaced by MiG   KUBs in           INS Hansa is also the site of Asia s first Shore Based Test Facility  SBTF   built in      to train pilots of the MiG   K for the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya      INS Hansa is home to several squadrons of the Indian Navy  operating aircraft such as Mikoyan MiG   Ks  Kamov Ka   s  Ilyushin Il   s  Dornier    s  The Navy s Sagar Pawan aerobatic team is also based at Dabolim  Apart from being a naval airbase  INS Hansa hosts the Coast Guard Air Enclave  CGAE    Goa and also sees regular exercises by Indian Air Force aircraft  The Navy also operates a naval aviation museum near Dabolim Airport   Military flight training edit  Military flight training at Dabolim is carried out on five days of the week from      hrs to      hrs  during which civilian flights cannot operate  Some exceptions have been made on rare occasions by the naval ATC  chiefly in the case of foreign airlines  Charter airlines carrying international tourists during the season tend to use the freer civil aviation regimes on weekends  Saturday and Sunday  and in the early morning hours  The blocked time is about     of the total on a weekly basis albeit during peak morning hours for civilian flights   Campaign to revert to civilian status edit  There has been a demand in local political circles for the restoration of Dabolim s civilian status by relocating the Indian Navy  air station to the proposed Karwar airfield in the new INS Kadamba naval base at Karwar     kilometres     mi  south of Dabolim in the adjoining state of Karnataka  However  the Indian Navy s top officers in Goa have hinted that the investment at Dabolim naval air station is      billion  US    million  and that it would be impossible to replicate this at Karwar      In early       there were reports of a concerted move by the Navy  the AAI  and the state of Karnataka to extend the runway planned at the naval base at Karwar to       metres        ft  to accommodate Airbus A   s and to acquire    extra hectares for this purpose      In       the Navy affirmed that Hansa would retain its assets and position as an important station for the Indian Navy  despite the commissioning of INS Kadamba       Air cargo edit  An estimated       tonnes        short tons  of cargo were handled annually as of a few years ago  when   and may have declined since then  Most air cargo is carried in the belly space of airlines such as Air India rather than in dedicated freighters  As of       all domestic cargo is handled at Dabolim airport  GoAir  Vistara  and other airlines use AAI s facilities  including machines  to process cargo during non peak hours  AAI has plans to build and operate a   x  cargo terminal at Dabolim in the old international terminal  Once completed  the common user terminal for cargo would be able to cater to both domestic and international cargo flights on a continuous basis       Ground transportation edit  Passengers can reach the airport using taxis  buses  trains  or automobiles  Public buses go to the nearby city of Vasco da Gama  approximately   km      mi  away  and also stop at the closer Chicalim bus stop  about     km       mi  from the airport  Local mini buses connect both Vasco da Gama and Chicalim to the airport  Pre paid taxis are available from the airport  There are various new transportation plans in the works  including the addition of a second bridge  Meanwhile  plans for a   lane  north to south expressway are on hold in Goa  A monorail system is also being considered  All these plans have implications for the proposed Mopa Airport and its link to Dabolim and Goa s population centres  The nearest station is Dabolim railway station  The port at Mormugao is located about   km      mi  away  Konkan Railway provides services to Margao in South Goa  Tivim in North Goa  Carambolim  and Ponda   Accidents and incidents edit  On   October       two Indian Navy Ilyushin Il   s collided and crashed near Dabolim Airport  killing    naval personnel in the planes and three civilians on the ground  Both aircraft were part of an air show to celebrate the   th anniversary of the naval Air Squadron                  On    October       two pilots and a technical sailor on board a HAL Chetak helicopter of the Indian Navy were killed after the helicopter crashed whilst landing towards the eastern side of the runway      On    December       Jet Airways flight  W       a Boeing          took a     degree spin as it veered of the runway damaging the landing gear  Of the seven crew members and     passengers     passengers suffered minor injuries          On   January       a MIG   K fighter aircraft of the Navy with a trainee pilot crashed off the runway during takeoff at Dabolim Airport  There were no casualties      On    December       a SpiceJet Flight SG       a De Havilland Canada Dash    was on final approach for landing when the runway controller noticed that the nose landing gear was not deployed  He immediately alerted the ATC tower and informed the aircraft to abort the landing and make a second attempt after a go around  The second attempt proved unsuccessful  In the third attempt the landing gear was partially deployed and the aircraft safely landed at Dabolim Airport  There were no casualties      See also edit  Airports in India List of busiest airports in India by passenger traffic

for  Flight   is a regional airport development programme of the Government of India and part of the Regional Connectivity Scheme  RCS  of upgrading under serviced air routes  RCS scheme consists of setting up Greenfield airports and as well as upgradation of Brownfield airports  Its objective is to make air travel more accessible and contribute to economic development in India        At the beginning of the scheme  out of a total of     airports      were under serviced    and only    were well served  out of    non RCS airports       only    were operational        The UDAN scheme was created to add to this number by expediting the development and operationalization of India s potential target of nearly     unserved  under served  and mostly underdeveloped regional airports with regularly scheduled flights     However  several issues and criticisms of its poor infrastructure      dominance by larger airlines  degradation of regional airlines      and slow implementation     have plagued the scheme  In October       India has     operational airports for civil aviation  including    international     customs      domestic  and few more civil aviation enclaves within military air bases  India is also planning to build the second airports in the big cities to decongest    by          by      and    plus by           UDAN RCS is integrated with other Government of India schemes  such as Bharatmala  Sagarmala  Parvatmala  Setu Bharatam  Dedicated Freight Corridors  Industrial corridor  BharatNet  Digital India and Make in India  National e Governance Plan  Startup India and Standup India    Phases edit  UDAN         new airports were commissioned      flight routes for    airports were awarded to   airline companies  UDAN      A helipad was added for the first time  In          unserved airports were announced  UDAN      Several changes were made  including tourist routes  seaplanes to connect water aerodromes  and routes under  UDAN  in the North East region  UDAN         new routes were approved in       In this phase  the Kavaratti  Agatti  and Minicoy islands of Lakshadweep will also be connected by new routes  UDAN      This phase is focused on connecting small airports  special helicopter  and seaplane routes under UDAN  New ways have also been proposed under Sagarmala seaplane services   Details edit  See also  Aviation in India and List of airlines of India The UDAN Scheme is a key component of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi s National Civil Aviation Policy  NCAP  which was released by the Ministry of Civil Aviation  India  on    June           The scheme will be jointly funded by the central government and state governments  Several states have come on board by signing the  Memorandum of Understanding  with the union government for this scheme     UDAN RCS will connect an unspecified number of new regional routes by operationalizing     regional airports by the end of the           financial year  with a target of    lakhs      million  annual passenger seats  It will require      crore    billion rupees  in viability gap funding  VGF  annually      Qualifying routes must have three to seven flights per week from the same airport      The scheme has two components  The first component is to develop new airports and enhance the existing regional airports to increase the number of operational airports for scheduled civilian flights from     in May       a total    operational including army airports      to at least     airports  by December       with regularly scheduled flights            Initially  more than     underserved  no more than   scheduled flights per week  and unserved regional airports will be developed by December       for which the initial funding of         million  equivalent to     billion  US     million or      million in       for the enhancement of    regional airports was approved in May                 Out of the total    airports included in round I     are regional airports to be newly operationalized  RCS Udan operations have commenced from    regional airports and additional    regional airports are ready to receive flights     regional airports still require significant upgrades  November           The second component is to add several hundred financially viable  capped airfare  new regional flight routes to connect more than     underserved and unserved

bidding for the award of routes will be concluded by the end of           Union government s share of  Viability Gap Funding  is from the cess applied to flights to popular routes to main cities and respective state governments have also offered additional benefits to the flight operators to make UDAN RCS viable      The number of aircraft increased by     to     in December      from     in       and    aircraft are being added every year      Subsequent phases with the inclusion of seaplanes will boost the number of potential landing sites from nearly     airports to over five lakhs           waterbodies as well as more locations along India s        km coastline          SpiceJet placed a US     million order for     of these    seater amphibian seaplanes  December                India

            A total of    airports were operationalized for civilian flights in India since independence  the government has newly operationalized additional    regional airports for civilian flights including   civil enclaves within the army airports  with regularly scheduled flights  within the single financial year of            with the target to complete a cumulative total of    operational regional airports by the end of            and eventually  operationalize a cumulative total of     regional airports by December               Indian prime minister Narendra Modi launched the scheme on    April      by flagging off the inaugural regional flights between Delhi and Shimla  and also between Kadapa Hyderabad Nanded       Concessions to operators edit  The scheme will run for    years

viability of the regional airports  by lowering the cost of flight operations and through financial support in the form of viability gap funding  VGF   VGF will be available to flight operators on specific routes for the first   years of operation      The demand driven revival and enhancement of the regional airports with financially viable commercial flight routes is based on the combination of seeking firm proposals from Airlines for the names of airports they wish to fly to and MoU bound commitment from the state governments for providing various concessions for the airport operations  such as state tax concessions  free land and security  etc     Participating states  Northeast states and Union Territories are required to sign the MoU with the union governments to share the     and     burden of VGF respectively             To make the routes viable for commercial airlines  the union government offers flexible code sharing arrangements  reduced excise on value added tax on fuel and service tax     Airports  some owned by the Airports Authority of India and others by the respective state governments     will not charge the landing and parking charges and terminal navigation landing charges         Airlines will be given Value Gap Funding  VGF  raised from the RCS levy     Starting from       the airfare cap and VGF in this    year scheme will be revised quarterly  based on Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers          UDAN RCS levy edit  RCS subsidy will be raised by levying a cess  which will be revised periodically  on the flight between main trunk routes connecting major cities      Starting from   June       it is initially at a flat rate of        per flight  translating into roughly     per passenger       Impact of STOL  seaplanes  ski and bush planes on UDAN RCS edit  While UDAN phase I had focused on fixed wing aircraft  Phase II included helicopters also  Subsequent phases were supposed to include STOL seaplanes and ski and bush planes operating from STOLports  On   December       SpiceJet conducted seaplane trials using a Quest Kodiak aircraft  in association with Japan s Setouchi Holdings  who owned Quest Aircraft company LLC at that time  SpiceJet was planning to buy     Quest Kodiak amphibian seaplanes for US     million  including long term parts and maintenance  December               The trials were conducted from Girgaum Chowpatty off the Mumbai coast with Union minister Nitin Gadkari on board  At the occasion  Gadkari claimed that seaplanes had the potential to revolutionize air transport in the country  possibly opening up many more destinations by enhancing the potential pool of landing sites from nearly     airports to over five lakh           waterbodies and thousand more locations along India s       km long coastline  He said that the Civil Aviation Ministry and Water and River Resources Ministry would soon formulate rules for the seaplane operations along the lines of those in nations like United States  Canada and Japan      A few days later on    December       Prime Minister Modi also rode a Quest Kodiak operated from Sabarmati River to Dharoi Dam          In       the third round of the UDAN scheme awarded    air routes connecting six water aerodrome sites to be connected by seaplanes      The water aerodrome sites are Guwahati river front  Nagarjuna Sagar  Sabarmati river front

has been revised  The funding that was provided for Category   and   air crafts  which generally have     seats  has now been enhanced to all flights in the states of HP  Uttarakhand  J K  Northeastern states and the islands  Also  the phase will allow operation of helicopter and seaplanes  The phase also plans to promote short haul routes  meaning no monetary support will be given to operators with stages more than     km       UDAN RCS Round V  April       edit  Following the four successful rounds of bidding  the Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched the  th round of UDAN to further enhance the connectivity to remote and regional areas of the country and achieve last mile connectivity on    April           Key Features of UDAN     are as follows   This round of UDAN focuses on Category          seats  and Category        seats   The earlier stage length cap of     km is waived and there is no restriction on the distance between the origin and destination of the flight  Viability gap funding  VGF  to be provided will be capped at     km stage length for both Priority and Non Priority areas which was earlier capped at     km  No predetermined routes would be offered  Only Network and Individual Route Proposal proposed by airlines will be considered  The airlines would be required to submit an action business plan after   months from the issuance of LoA wherein they submit their aircraft acquisition plan availability of aircraft  crew  slots  etc  at the time of the Technical Proposal  The same route will not be awarded to a single airline more than once  whether in different networks or in the same network  Exclusivity will be withdrawn if the average quarterly PLF is higher than     for four continuous quarters  to prevent exploitation of the monopoly on a route      of the Performance Guarantee to be encashed for each month of delay up to   months  to further incentivize quick operationalization  Airlines would be required to commence operations within   months of the award of the route  Earlier this deadline was   months  A list of airports that are ready for operation or would soon be ready for operations has been included in the scheme to facilitate quicker operationalization of routes under the Scheme  Novation process for routes from one operator to another is simplified and incentivized  Summary status table edit  Total in

large metro cities  shortage of pilots  lack of favorable rules and still pending reforms in DGCA  aviation regulator  and AAI rules and regulations are the main hurdles  most of these the government is responsible for  c     December            Situation will get worse as airlines plan to add     aircraft  such as IndiGo          A   s and    ATRs by      to its existing     aircraft   SpiceJet

 from      to      to its existing         AAI announced that as the part of its          million  equivalent to      billion or US     billion in       infrastructure upgrade plans over next   years        it will add     bays at    major airports against the industry requirement of     overnight parking bays at    airports in next   years  c     December            The solution lies in the policy intervention  such as reserving at least     bays for the regional routes at the metro airports       Criticisms edit  A      analysis by Outlook of the first two phases of RCS routes notes that the success rate of UDAN was less than    per cent  Of the     odd air routes allotted to    major and fledgling airlines under the two phases of UDAN  not more than    to    routes were operating regularly  This was because smaller operators such as Zoom Air  Trujet  Pinnacle Airlines  Heritage and AAA Aviation had succumbed to operational issues  Industry experts pointed out several operational  technical  procedural and financial problems in the scheme that failed to create a proper ecosystem for smaller operators due to which the operational costs of the operators of small aircraft went so high that the government subsidy could not compensate  The scheme hence benefited only the operators of larger aircraft like the ATR    and the Airbus A         A close examination of the distribution of successful UDAN routes by operator  shows most of the successful routes have come from large operators like SpiceJet and IndiGo  Both these airlines have chosen to not take the Viability Gap Funding subsidy  but are instead leveraging the scheme strategically towards gaining additional slots for themselves at congested Tier   airports and gaining monopoly status on routes      Aviation consultancy firm CAPA India had predicted that the success of the scheme would depend on the participation established airlines  since in its current form  UDAN does not make a business case for small and independent operators who cannot benefit from the economies of scale      In its report   Indian Aviation Outlook for FY       CAPA India pointed out that  the chances of failure of regional airlines operating older aircraft  dispersed across multiple stations without rigorous demand assessment  and in the absence of a maintenance ecosystem is significant       However  UDAN cannot run without small aircraft operators as only small aircraft can land and take off from the majority of the     airports that the scheme intends to bring online  citation needed      The scheme also faced criticism for the financing model it had adopted  A viability gap funding structure  where a surcharge was levied on tickets on existing routes  which would be used to refund part of the ticket costs for the airlines flying on UDAN route  was adopted which didn t go down well with various quarters      Critics have also pointed out issues in Scheme execution such as AAI s selection of airports that lack supporting economic activity  Leisure and native traffic alone will not stimulate demand at small airports  Demand for air travel is created and sustained by the presence of industries and the services sector  Critics blame faulty planning of the AAI and political influence  Demand surveys have failed to correctly predict future passenger traffic demand       See also

Aviation safety is the study and practice of managing risks in aviation  This includes preventing aviation accidents and incidents through research  training aviation personnel  protecting passengers and the general public  and designing safer aircraft and aviation infrastructure  The aviation industry is subject to significant regulations and oversight to reduce risks across all aspects of flight     Adverse weather conditions such as turbulence  thunderstorms  icing  and reduced visibility are also recognized as major contributing factors to aviation safety outcomes  Aviation security is focused on protecting air travelers  aircraft and infrastructure from intentional harm or disruption  rather than unintentional mishaps    Statistics edit  Evolution edit  Yearly fatalities a  since

ever been  Modern commercial aviation boasts an accident rate of approximately   fatal accident per    million flights  far lower than historic numbers     On December           the Wright Brothers conducted a test flight of their powered airplane from the slope of Big Kill Devil Hill in North Carolina  Upon takeoff  the airplane lifted about    feet off the ground  stalled  and crashed into the sand     Only three days later  on December           Wilbur s brother  Orville Wright flew the airplane for the world s first powered  sustained  and controlled heavier than air flight in history  Although the failed test flight on December    would be mostly forgotten in aviation  it remains one of the earliest recorded aviation accidents in history  In the early years of air travel  accidents were exceedingly common       was named the year of  The Great Crash  due to the frequency of aircraft accidents that occurred during the year  with    fatal accidents officially reported     In      and       the overall accident rate was about   in every million miles      million kilometers  flown     In today s industry  that accident rate would translate to about       fatal accidents each year  For the ten year period      to           fatal accidents happened per one million flights globally      per million hours flown       fatalities per one million flights or      per million hours flown     From     million passengers in       air transport had grown to       million in       led by     million in the United States  then     million in China     In          fatal accidents involved civil airliners with more than    passengers  These accidents resulted in     fatalities   the second safest year ever after      with    accidents and      with     fatalities     For planes heavier than     metric tones  there were      million departures and    accidents worldwide with   of these fatal for     fatalities  the lowest since             fatalities per million

Transportation type  Deaths per billion   Journeys  Hours  Kilometers   Bus                Rail             Van             Private Car              Foot               Water             Air                 Pedal cycle                Motorcycle                   Paragliding b                     Skydiving                       Space Shuttle                         The first two statistics are computed for typical travels by their respective forms of transport  so they cannot be used directly to compare risks related to different forms of transport in a particular travel  from A to B   For example  these statistics suggest that a typical flight from Los Angeles to New York would carry a larger risk factor than a typical car travel from home to office  However  car travel from Los Angeles to New York would not be typical  that journey would be as long as several dozen typical car travels  and thus the associated risk would be larger as well  Because the journey would take a much longer time  the overall risk associated with making this journey by car would be higher than making the same journey by air  even if each individual hour of car travel is less risky than each hour of flight  For risks associated with long range intercity travel  the most suitable statistic is the third one  deaths per billion kilometers  Still  this statistic can lose credence in situations where the availability of an air option makes an otherwise inconvenient journey possible  Aviation industry insurers base their calculations on the deaths per journey statistic while the aviation industry itself generally uses the deaths per kilometre statistic in press releases      Since       the number of fatal air accidents has been no more than   for every               person miles c  flown  citation needed  and thus is one of the safest modes of transportation when measured by distance traveled  The Economist notes that air travel is safer by distance travelled  but trains are as safe as planes      It also notes that cars are four times more hazardous for deaths per time travelled  and cars and trains are respectively three times and six times safer than planes by number of journeys taken      Because the above figures are focused on providing a perspective to the realm of everyday transportation  air travel is taken to include only standard civil passenger aviation  as offered commercially to the general public  Military and special purpose aircraft are excluded   United States edit  Between      and       there were      commuter and air taxi accidents in the U S  of which           were fatal  resulting in       deaths  including     accidents       and     fatalities       in Alaska alone      The number of deaths per passenger mile on commercial airlines in the United States between      and      was about     deaths per    billion passenger miles          For driving  the rate was     per    billion vehicle miles for           times higher per mile than for flying in a commercial airplane  There were no fatalities on large scheduled commercial airlines in the United States for over nine years  between the Colgan Air Flight      crash in February       and a catastrophic engine failure on Southwest Airlines Flight      in April            Security edit  Another aspect of safety is protection from intentional harm or property damage  also known as security  The terrorist attacks of      are not counted as accidents  However  even if they were counted as accidents they would have added about   death per billion person miles  Two months later  American Airlines Flight     crashed in New York City  killing     people  including   on the ground  causing      to show a very high fatality rate  Even so  the rate that year including the attacks  estimated here to be about   deaths per billion person miles   is safe compared to some other forms of transport when measured by distance traveled   Developments edit  Before WWII edit  The first aircraft electrical or electronic device avionics system was Lawrence Sperry s autopilot  demonstrated in June            The Transcontinental Airway System chain of beacons was built by the Commerce Department in      to guide airmail flights      Gyrocopters were developed by Juan de la Cierva to avoid stall and spin accidents  and for that invented cyclic and collective controls used by helicopters       The first flight of a gyrocopter was on    January       During the     s  the first laws were passed in the United States of America to regulate civil aviation  notably the Air Commerce Act of       which required pilots and aircraft to be examined and licensed  for accidents to be properly investigated  and for the establishment of safety rules and navigation aids  under the Aeronautics Branch of the United States Department of Commerce  US DoC   A network of aerial lighthouses was established in the United Kingdom and Europe during the     s and     s       Use of the lighthouses has declined with the advent of radio navigation aids such as non directional beacon  NDB   VHF omnidirectional range  VOR   and distance measuring equipment  DME    The last operational aerial lighthouse in the United Kingdom is on top of the cupola over the RAF College main hall at RAF Cranwell  One of the first aids for air navigation to be introduced in the United States in the late     s was airfield lighting  to assist pilots in making landings in poor weather or after dark   The Precision Approach Path Indicator  PAPI  was developed from this in the     s  indicating to the pilot the angle of descent to the airfield   This later became adopted internationally through the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO   Jimmy Doolittle developed instrument rating and made his first  blind  flight in September        The March      wooden wing failure of a Transcontinental   Western Air Fokker F    carrying Knute Rockne  coach of the University of Notre Dame s football team  reinforced all metal airframes and led to a more formal accident investigation system  On   September       a Douglas DC   test flight was conducted with one of the two engines shut down during the takeoff run  climbed to       feet        metres   and completed its flight  proving twin aircraft engine safety   With greater range than lights and weather immunity  radio navigation aids were first used in the     s  like the Australian Aeradio stations guiding transport flights  with a light beacon and a modified Lorenz beam transmitter  the German blind landing equipment preceding the modern instrument landing system   ILS        ILS was first used by a scheduled flight to make a landing in a snowstorm at Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  in       and a form of ILS was adopted by the ICAO for international use in        Post WWII edit  Hard runways were built worldwide for World War II to avoid waves and floating hazards plaguing seaplanes      Developed by the U S  and introduced during World War II  LORAN replaced the sailors  less reliable compass and celestial navigation over water and survived until it was replaced by the Global Positioning System       An airborne pulse Doppler radar antenna  Some airborne radars can be used as meteorological radars  Following the development of radar in World War II  it was deployed as a landing aid for civil aviation in the form of ground controlled approach  GCA  systems then as the airport surveillance radar as an aid to air traffic control in the     s  A number of ground based weather radar systems can detect areas of severe turbulence  A modern Honeywell Intuvue weather system visualizes weather patterns up to     miles      km  away  citation needed  Distance measuring equipment  DME  in      and VHF omnidirectional range  VOR  stations became the main route navigation means during the     s  superseding the low frequency radio ranges and the non directional beacon  NDB   the ground based VOR stations were often co located with DME transmitters and the pilots could establish their bearing and distance to the station       Jetliners edit  To highlight the jetliner evolution  Airbus split them in four generations    from       early jets  Comet  Caravelle  BAC      Trident  B     DC       have dials and gauges cockpits and early auto flight systems  from       new designs  A     F    BAe      B     original B    and B     L       DC    DC        have more elaborate autopilot and autothrottle systems  From       glass cockpit   FMS

 The fatal accident rate fell from     per million flights for the first generation to     for the next      for the third and     for the last      With the arrival of Wide Area Augmentation System  WAAS   satellite navigation has become accurate enough for altitude as well as positioning use  and is being used increasingly for instrument approaches as well as en route navigation  However  because the GPS constellation is a single point of failure  on board Inertial Navigation System  INS  or ground based navigation aids are still required for backup  In       Rockwell Collins reported it had become more costly to certify than to develop a system  from     engineering and     certification in past years      It calls for a global harmonization between certifying authorities to avoid redundant engineering and certification tests rather than recognizing the others approval and validation      Groundings of entire classes of aircraft out of equipment safety concerns is unusual  but this has occurred to the de Havilland Comet in      after multiple crashes due to metal fatigue and hull failure  the McDonnell Douglas DC    in      after the crash of American Airlines Flight     due to engine loss  the Boeing     Dreamliner in      after its battery problems  and the Boeing     MAX in      after two crashes preliminarily tied to a flight control system   Hazards edit  Unapproved parts edit  Main article  Unapproved aircraft part Parts manufactured without an aviation authority s approval are described as  unapproved   Unapproved parts include inferior counterfeits  those used beyond their time limits  those that were previously approved but not properly returned to service  those with fraudulent labels  production overruns that were not sold with the agency s permission  and those that are untraceable      Unapproved faulty parts have caused hundreds of incidents and crashes  some fatal  including about    crashes between      and                Foreign object debris edit  Main article  Foreign object debris Foreign object debris  FOD  includes items left in the aircraft structure during manufacture repairs  debris on the runway and solids encountered in flight  e g  hail and dust   Such items can damage engines and other parts of the aircraft  In       Air France Flight      crashed after hitting a part that had fallen from a departing Continental Airlines DC      Misleading information and lack of information edit  A pilot misinformed by a printed document  manual  map  etc    reacting to a faulty instrument or indicator  in the cockpit or on the ground           or following inaccurate instructions or information from flight or ground control can lose situational awareness  or make errors  and accidents or near misses may result                  The crash of Air New Zealand Flight     was a result of receiving and interpreting incorrect coordinates  which caused the pilots to inadvertently fly into a mountain   Lightning edit  Boeing studies showed that airliners are struck by lightning twice per year on average  aircraft withstand typical lightning strikes without damage  The dangers of more powerful positive lightning were not understood until the destruction of a glider in           It has since been suggested that positive lightning might have caused the crash of Pan Am Flight     in       At that time  aircraft were not designed to withstand such strikes because their existence was unknown  The      standard in force in the US at the time of the glider crash  Advisory Circular AC      A      was replaced by Advisory Circular AC      B in           However  it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated          The effects of typical lightning on traditional metal covered aircraft are well understood and serious damage from a lightning strike on an airplane is rare  Modern airliners like the Boeing     Dreamliner with exteriors and wings made from carbon fiber reinforced polymer have been tested and shown to receive no damage from lightning strikes during testing       Ice and snow edit  Snow building on the intake to a Rolls Royce RB    engine of a Boeing          Snow and ice present unique threats and aircraft operating in these weather conditions often require de icing equipment  Ice and snow can be major factors in airline accidents  In       Southwest Airlines Flight      slid off the end of a runway after landing in heavy snow conditions  killing one child on the ground  Even a small amount of icing or coarse frost can greatly impair the ability of a wing to develop adequate lift  which is why regulations prohibit ice  snow or even frost on the wings or tail  prior to takeoff      Air Florida Flight    crashed on takeoff in       as a result of ice snow on its wings  An accumulation of ice during flight can be catastrophic  as evidenced by the loss of control and subsequent crashes of American Eagle Flight      in       and Comair Flight      in       Both aircraft were turboprop airliners  with straight wings  which tend to be more susceptible to inflight ice accumulation  than are swept wing jet airliners      Airlines and airports ensure that aircraft are properly de iced before takeoff whenever the weather involves icing conditions  Modern airliners are designed to prevent ice buildup on wings  engines  and tails  empennage  by either routing heated air from jet engines through the leading edges of the wing  and inlets      or on slower aircraft  by use of inflatable rubber  boots  that expand to break off any accumulated ice  Airline flight plans require airline dispatch offices to monitor the progress of weather along the routes of their flights  helping the pilots to avoid the worst of inflight icing conditions  Aircraft can also be equipped with an ice detector in order to warn pilots to leave unexpected ice accumulation areas  before the situation becomes critical      Pitot tubes in modern airplanes and helicopters have been provided with the function of  Pitot Heating  to prevent accidents like Air France Flight     caused by the pitot tube freezing and giving false readings   Wind shear or microburst edit  Effect of wind shear on aircraft trajectory  Note how merely correcting for the initial gust front can have dire consequences  A wind shear is a change in wind speed and or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere  A microburst is a localized column of sinking air that drops down in a thunderstorm  Both of these are potential weather threats that may cause an aviation accident       Wreckage of Delta Air Lines Flight     tail section after a microburst slammed the aircraft into the ground Strong outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three dimensional wind velocity just above ground level  Initially  this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed  which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear  As the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft  the localized headwind diminishes  reducing the aircraft s airspeed and increasing its sink rate  Then  when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft  the headwind becomes a tailwind  reducing lift generated by the wings  and leaving the aircraft in a low power  low speed descent  This can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact  Between      and       wind shear directly caused or contributed to    major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U S  that led to     deaths and     injuries       Engine failure edit  Further information  Turbine engine failure and ETOPS An engine may fail to function because

manufacturing defect in the engine  e g  Qantas Flight     United Airlines Flight      Delta Air Lines Flight        and pilot error  e g  Pinnacle Airlines Flight        In a multi engine aircraft  failure of a single engine usually results in a precautionary landing being performed  for example  landing at a diversion airport instead of continuing to the intended destination  Failure of a second engine  e g  US Airways Flight       or damage to other aircraft systems caused by an uncontained engine failure  e g  United Airlines Flight      may  if an emergency landing is not possible  result in the aircraft crashing   Structural failure of the aircraft edit  Examples of failure of aircraft structures caused by metal fatigue include the de Havilland Comet accidents      s  and Aloha Airlines Flight             Improper repair procedures can also cause structural failures include Japan Air Lines Flight            and China Airlines Flight             Now that the subject is better understood  rigorous inspection and nondestructive testing procedures are in place  Composite materials consist of layers of fibers embedded in a resin matrix  In some cases  especially when subjected to cyclic stress  the layers of the material separate from each other  delaminate  and lose strength  As the failure develops inside the material  nothing is shown on the surface  instrument methods  often ultrasound based  have to be used to detect such a material failure  In the     s several Yakovlev Yak  s experienced delamination of plywood in their construction   Design flaws edit  An error in the design of the aircraft itself can be a cause of accidents  even if the error was not the primary cause of the accident  Examples of this are Lion Air Flight            and Ethiopian Airlines Flight             which both suffered a loss of control in flight leading to both planes crashing  The cause was discovered to be a design flaw in the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System  MCAS  software that was designed to improve the handling of the Boeing     MAX aircraft  But instead caused both aircraft to pitch nose up uncontrollably in flight due to a faulty angle of attack sensor  as the design allowed for only one sensor s readings to be used      Another example is Airlines PNG Flight             which suffered a fatal forced landing  primarily due to a engine failure  This failure was discovered to be caused by a design flaw in the power levers  which allowed the pilot to accidentally place the levers into reverse due to the design of the levers       Stalling edit  Stalling an aircraft  increasing the angle of attack to a point at which the wings fail to produce enough lift  is dangerous and can result in a crash if the pilot fails to make a timely correction  Devices to warn the pilot when the aircraft s speed is decreasing close to the stall speed include stall warning horns  now standard on virtually all powered aircraft   stick shakers  and voice warnings  Most stalls are a result of the pilot allowing the airspeed to be too slow for the particular weight and configuration at the time  Stall speed is higher when ice or frost has attached to the wings and or tail stabilizer  The more severe the icing  the higher the stall speed  not only because smooth airflow over the wings becomes increasingly more difficult  but also because of the added weight of the accumulated ice  Crashes caused by a full stall of the airfoils include   British European Airways Flight            United Airlines Flight            Aeroflot Flight             Arrow Air Flight             Northwest Airlines Flight            The Paul Wellstone crash        Colgan Air Flight             Turkish Airlines Flight      crash        Air France Flight            Fire edit  Main article  In flight fire NASA air safety experiment  CID project  Safety regulations control aircraft materials and the requirements for automated fire safety systems  Usually these requirements take the form of required tests  The tests measure flammability of materials and toxicity of smoke  When the tests fail  it is on a prototype in an engineering laboratory rather than in an aircraft  Fire and its toxic smoke have been the cause of accidents  An electrical fire on Air Canada Flight     in      caused the deaths of    of the    passengers  resulting in the introduction of floor level lighting to assist people to evacuate a smoke filled aircraft  In       a fire on the runway caused the loss of    lives     from the effects of incapacitating and subsequently lethal toxic gas and smoke in the British Airtours Flight   M accident which raised serious concerns relating to survivability   something that had not been studied in such detail  The swift incursion of the fire into the fuselage and the layout of the aircraft impaired passengers  ability to evacuate  with areas such as the forward galley area becoming a bottle neck for escaping passengers  with some dying very close to the exits  Much research into evacuation and cabin and seating layouts was carried out at Cranfield Institute to try to measure what makes a good evacuation route  which led to the seat layout by Overwing exits being changed by mandate and the examination of evacuation requirements relating to the design of galley areas  The use of smoke hoods or misting systems were also examined although both were rejected  South African Airways Flight     was lost in the Indian Ocean in      after an in flight fire in the cargo hold could not be suppressed by the crew  The cargo holds of most airliners are now equipped with automated halon fire extinguishing systems to combat a fire that might occur in the baggage holds  In May       ValuJet Flight     crashed into the Florida Everglades a few minutes after takeoff because of a fire in the forward cargo hold  All     people on board were killed  At one time  fire fighting foam paths were laid down before an emergency landing  but the practice was considered only marginally effective  and concerns about the depletion of firefighting capability due to pre foaming led the United States FAA to withdraw its recommendation in       One possible cause of fires in airplanes is wiring problems that involve intermittent faults  such as wires with breached insulation touching each other  having water dripping on them  or short circuits  Notable was Swissair Flight     in      due to an arc in the wiring of IFE which ignited flammable MPET insulation  These are difficult to detect once the aircraft is on the ground  However  there are methods  such as spread spectrum time domain reflectometry  that can feasibly test live wires on aircraft during flight       Bird strike edit  Main article  Bird strike Bird strike is an aviation term for a collision between a bird and an aircraft  Fatal accidents have been caused by both engine failure following bird ingestion and bird strikes breaking cockpit windshields  Jet engines have to be designed to withstand the ingestion of birds of a specified weight and number and to not lose more than a specified amount of thrust  The weight and numbers of birds that can be ingested without hazarding the safe flight of the aircraft are related to the engine intake area      The hazards of ingesting birds beyond the  designed for  limit were shown on US Airways Flight      when the aircraft struck Canada geese  The outcome of an ingestion event and whether it causes an accident  be it on a small fast plane  such as military jet fighters  or a large transport  depends on the number and weight of birds and where they strike the fan blade span or the nose cone  Core damage usually results with impacts near the blade root or on the nose cone  The highest risk of a bird strike occurs during takeoff and landing in the vicinity of airports  and during low level flying  for example by military aircraft  crop dusters and helicopters  Some airports use active countermeasures  including a person with a shotgun  playing recorded sounds of predators through loudspeakers  or employing falconers  Poisonous grass can be planted that is not palatable to birds  nor to insects that attract insectivorous birds  Passive countermeasures involve sensible clarification needed  land use management  avoiding conditions attracting flocks of birds to the area  e g  landfills   Another tactic found effective is to let the grass at the airfield grow taller  to approximately    inches or    centimetres  as some species of birds won t land if they cannot see one another   Human factors edit  See also  Aviation medicine NASA air safety experiment  CID project   The airplane is a Boeing     testing a form of jet fuel  known as  antimisting kerosene   which formed a difficult to ignite gel when agitated violently  as in a crash  Human factors  including pilot error  are another potential set of factors  and currently the factor most commonly found in aviation accidents          Much progress in applying human factors analysis to improving aviation safety was made around the time of World War II by such pioneers as Paul Fitts and Alphonse Chapanis  However  there has been progress in safety throughout the history of aviation  such as the development of the pilot s checklist in           CRM  or crew resource management  is a technique that makes use of the experience and knowledge of the complete flight crew to avoid dependence on just one crew member  and to improve pilot decision making  Pilot error and improper communication are often factors in the collision of aircraft  This can take place in the air       Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight       TCAS  or on the ground       Tenerife disaster   RAAS   The barriers to effective communication have internal and external factors      The ability of the flight crew to maintain situational awareness is a critical human factor in air safety  Human factors training is available to general aviation pilots and called single pilot resource management training  Failure of the pilots to properly monitor the flight instruments caused the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight     in       Controlled flight into terrain  CFIT   and error during take off and landing can have catastrophic consequences  for example causing the crash of Prinair Flight     on landing  also in        Pilot fatigue edit  Main article  Pilot fatigue The International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  defines fatigue as  A physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss or extended wakefulness  circadian phase  or workload       The phenomenon places great risk on the crew and passengers of an airplane because it significantly increases the chance of pilot error      Fatigue is particularly prevalent among pilots because of  unpredictable work hours  long duty periods  circadian disruption  and insufficient sleep       These factors can occur together to produce a combination of sleep deprivation  circadian rhythm effects  and  time on task  fatigue      Regulators attempt to mitigate fatigue by limiting the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly over varying periods of time  Experts in aviation fatigue who   often find that these methods fall short of their goals   Piloting while intoxicated edit  Rarely  flight crew members are arrested or subject to disciplinary action for being intoxicated on the job  In       three Northwest Airlines crew members were sentenced to jail for flying while drunk  In       Northwest fired a pilot who failed a breathalyzer test after a flight  In July       both pilots of America West Airlines Flight     were arrested just before they were scheduled to fly because they had been drinking alcohol  The pilots were fired and the FAA revoked their pilot licenses      At least one fatal airliner accident involving drunk pilots occurred when Aero Flight     crashed at Kvevlax  Finland  killing all    on board in       Another example is the crash Aeroflot Flight      in which the captain s intoxication contributed to the accident  killing all    on board   Pilot suicide and murder edit  This section does not cite any sources  Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   April        Learn how and when to remove this message  Main article  Suicide by pilot There have been rare instances of suicide by pilots   Although most air crew are screened for psychological fitness  a very few authorized pilots have flown acts of suicide and even mass murder       In       Japan Airlines Flight     crashed while on approach to the Tokyo Haneda Airport  killing    of the     on board   The official investigation found the mentally ill captain had attempted suicide by placing the inboard engines into reverse thrust  while the aircraft was close to the runway   The first officer did not have enough time to countermand before the aircraft stalled and crashed  In       SilkAir Flight     suddenly went into a high dive from its cruising altitude   The speed of the dive was so high that the aircraft began to break apart before it finally crashed near Palembang  Sumatra   After three years of investigation  the Indonesian authorities declared that the cause of the accident could not be determined   However  the US NTSB concluded that deliberate suicide by the captain was the only reasonable explanation  In      in the case of EgyptAir Flight      it appears that the first officer deliberately crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while the captain was away from his station      Crew involvement is one of the speculative theories in the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight     on   March       On    March       Germanwings Flight       an Airbus A         crashed     kilometres     miles  north west of Nice  in the French Alps  after a constant descent that began one minute after the last routine contact with air traffic control  and shortly after the aircraft had reached its assigned cruise altitude   All     passengers and six crew members were killed   The crash was intentionally caused by the co pilot  Andreas Lubitz   Having been declared  unfit to work  without telling his employer  Lubitz reported for duty  and during the flight locked the captain out of the flight deck   In response to the incident and the circumstances of Lubitz s involvement  aviation authorities in Canada  New Zealand  Germany  and Australia implemented new regulations that require two authorised personnel to be present in the cockpit at all times   Three days after the incident  the European Aviation Safety Agency  EASA  issued a temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure that at least two crew members  including at least one pilot  are in the cockpit at all times of the flight   Several airlines announced they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily   Deliberate aircrew inaction edit  Inaction  omission  failure to act as required  willful disregard of safety procedures  disdain for rules  and unjustifiable risk taking by pilots have also led to accidents and incidents  Although Smartwings QS      flight of    August      successfully made an emergency landing at destination  the captain was censured for failing to follow mandatory procedures  including for not landing at the nearest possible diversion airport after an engine failure   Human factors of third parties edit  Unsafe human factors are not limited to pilot errors  Third party factors include  ground crew mishaps  ground vehicle to aircraft collisions and engineering maintenance related problems  For example  failure to properly close a cargo door on Turkish Airlines Flight     in      caused the loss of the aircraft   However  design of the cargo door latch was also a major factor in the accident   In the case of Japan Air Lines Flight     in       improper repair of previous damage led to explosive decompression of the cabin  which in turn destroyed the vertical stabilizer and damaged all four hydraulic systems which powered all the flight controls   Controlled flight into terrain edit  Main article  Controlled flight into terrain See also  Box canyon  aviation  Controlled flight into terrain  CFIT  is a class of accidents in which an aircraft is flown under control into terrain or man made structures  CFIT accidents typically result from pilot error or of navigational system error  Failure to protect ILS critical areas can also cause CFIT accidents dubious   discuss   In December       American Airlines Flight     tracked off course while approaching Cali  Colombia  and hit a mountainside despite a terrain awareness and warning system  TAWS  terrain warning in the cockpit and desperate pilot attempt to gain altitude after the warning  Crew position awareness and monitoring of navigational systems are essential to the prevention of CFIT accidents  As of February      update   over        aircraft had enhanced TAWS installed  and they had flown over     million hours without a CFIT accident      Another anti CFIT tool is the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning  MSAW  system which monitors the altitudes transmitted by aircraft transponders and compares that with the system s defined minimum safe altitudes for a given area  When the system determines the aircraft is lower  or might soon be lower  than the minimum safe altitude  the air traffic controller receives an acoustic and visual warning and then alerts the pilot that the aircraft is too low       Electromagnetic interference edit  See also  Mobile phones on aircraft and Electromagnetic interference The use of certain electronic equipment is partially or entirely prohibited as it might interfere with aircraft operation      such as causing compass deviations  citation needed  Use of some types of personal electronic devices is prohibited when an aircraft is below        feet        m   taking off  or landing  Use of a mobile phone is prohibited on most flights because in flight usage creates problems with ground based cells          Wireless devices such as cellphones feature an airplane mode   Ground damage edit  Ground damage to an aircraft  Several stringers were cut and the aircraft was grounded  Various ground support equipment operate in close proximity to the fuselage and wings to service the aircraft and occasionally cause accidental damage in the form of scratches in the paint or small dents in the skin  However  because aircraft structures  including the outer skin  play such a critical role in the safe operation of a flight  all damage is inspected  measured  and possibly tested to ensure that any damage is within safe tolerances  An example problem was the depressurization incident on Alaska Airlines Flight     in       During ground services  a baggage handler hit the side of the aircraft with a tug towing a train of baggage carts  This damaged the metal skin of the aircraft  This damage was not reported and the plane departed  Climbing through        feet        m  the damaged section of the skin gave way under the difference in pressure between the inside of the aircraft and the outside air  The cabin depressurized explosively necessitating a rapid descent to denser  breathable  air and an emergency landing  Post landing examination of the fuselage revealed a    inch     cm  hole on the right side of the airplane       Volcanic ash edit  Main article  Volcanic ash and aviation safety Plumes of volcanic ash near active volcanoes can damage propellers  engines and cockpit windows           In       British Airways Flight   flew through an ash cloud and temporarily lost power from all four engines  The plane was badly damaged  with all the leading edges being scratched  The front windscreens had been so badly  sand  blasted by the ash that they could not be used to land the aircraft      Prior to      the general approach taken by airspace regulators was that if the ash concentration rose above zero  then the airspace was considered unsafe and was consequently closed      Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers enable liaison between meteorologists  volcanologists  and the aviation industry       Runway safety edit  Airport safety car at an Airport in Taiwan Main article  Runway safety Types of runway safety incidents include   Runway excursion   an incident involving only a single aircraft making an inappropriate exit from the runway  Runway overrun   a specific type of excursion where the aircraft does not stop before the end of the runway  e g   Air France Flight       Runway incursion   incorrect presence of a vehicle  person  or another aircraft on the runway  e g   Tenerife airport disaster   Runway confusion   crew misidentification of the runway for landing or take off  e g   Comair Flight       Singapore Airlines Flight     The last two types can be prevented with airport surveillance and broadcast systems  a Runway Awareness and Advisory System  and landing navigation systems  e g  transponder landing system  microwave landing system  instrument landing system    Terrorism edit  Aircrew are normally trained to handle hijack situations           Since the September          attacks  stricter airport and airline security measures are in place to prevent terrorism  such as security checkpoints and locking the cockpit doors during flight  In the United States  the Federal Flight Deck Officer program is run by the Federal Air Marshal Service  with the aim of training active and licensed airline pilots to carry weapons and defend their aircraft against criminal activity and terrorism  Upon completion of government training  selected pilots enter a covert law enforcement and counter terrorism service  Their jurisdiction is normally limited to a flight deck or a cabin of a commercial airliner or a cargo aircraft they operate while on duty   Military action edit  Passenger planes have rarely been attacked in both peacetime and war  Examples   In       Bulgaria shot down El Al Flight      In       Israel shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight      In       the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight      In       the United States shot down Iran Air Flight      In       the Ukrainian Air Force accidentally shot down Siberia Airlines Flight      during an exercise  In       Russia shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight         In       Iran shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight      Accident survivability edit  Further information  Pre flight safety demonstration  Aircraft safety card  Brace position  Aircraft rescue and firefighting  and Airport crash tender Earlier tragedies investigations and improved engineering has allowed many safety improvements that have allowed an increasing safer aviation       Airport design edit  EMAS bed after being run over by landing gear Airport design and location can have a large impact on aviation safety  especially since some airports such as Chicago Midway International Airport were originally built for propeller planes and many airports are in congested areas where it is difficult to meet newer safety standards  For instance  the FAA issued rules in      calling for a runway safety area  usually extending     metres      ft  to each side and     metres        ft  beyond the end of a runway  This is intended to cover ninety percent of the cases of an aircraft leaving the runway by providing a buffer space free of obstacles      Many older airports do not meet this standard  One method of substituting for the     metres        ft  at the end of a runway for airports in congested areas is to install an engineered materials arrestor system  EMAS   These systems are usually made of lightweight  crushable concrete that absorbs the energy of the aircraft to bring it to a rapid stop  As of      update   they have stopped three aircraft at JFK Airport   Emergency airplane evacuations edit  According to a      report by the National Transportation Safety Board  emergency aircraft evacuations happen about once every    days in the U S  While some situations are extremely dire  such as when the plane is on fire  in many cases the greatest challenge for passengers can be the use of the evacuation slide  In a Time article on the subject  Amanda Ripley reported that when a new supersized Airbus A    underwent mandatory evacuation tests in       thirty three of the     evacuating volunteers got hurt  While the evacuation was considered a success  one volunteer suffered a broken leg  while the remaining    received slide burns   Such accidents are common  In her article  Ripley provided tips on how to make it down the airplane slide without injury      Another improvement to airplane evacuations is the requirement by the Federal Aviation Administration for planes to demonstrate an evacuation time of    seconds with half the emergency exits blocked for each type of airplane in their fleet  According to studies     seconds is the time needed to evacuate before the plane starts burning  before there can be a very large fire or explosions  or before fumes fill the cabin           Aircraft materials and design edit  Changes such as using new materials for seat fabric and insulation has given between    and    additional seconds to people on board to evacuate before the cabin gets filled with fire and potential deadly fumes      Other improvements through the years include the use of properly rated seatbelts  impact resistant seat frames  and airplane wings and engines designed to shear off to absorb impact forces       Radar and wind shear detection systems edit  As the result of the accidents due to wind shear and other weather disturbances  most notably the      crash of Delta Air Lines Flight      the U S  Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on board wind shear detection systems by           Since       the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years  due to the mandated on board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground  NEXRAD       The installation of high resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U S  airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions       Accidents and incidents edit  List of airship accidents Lists of aviation

investigators edit  Air safety investigators are trained and authorized to investigate aviation accidents and incidents  to research  analyse  and report their conclusions  They may be specialized in flight operations  training  aircraft structures  air traffic control  flight recorders or human factors  They are employed by government organizations responsible for aviation safety  manufacturers or unions  though only government organizations have statutory powers to investigate   Safety improvement initiatives edit  The safety improvement initiatives are aviation safety partnerships between regulators  manufacturers  operators  professional unions  research organisations  and international aviation organisations to further enhance safety      Some major safety initiatives worldwide are   Commercial Aviation Safety Team  CAST  in the US  The Commercial Aviation Safety Team  CAST  was founded in      with a goal to reduce the commercial aviation fatality rate in the United States by    percent by       European Strategic Safety Initiative  ESSI    The European Strategic Safety Initiative  ESSI  is an aviation safety partnership between EASA  other regulators and the industry  The initiative objective is to further enhance safety for citizens in Europe and worldwide through safety analysis  implementation of cost effective action plans  and coordination with other safety initiatives worldwide  After the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight      in June       the International Air Transport Association said it was working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time  A special panel was considering a range of options including the production of equipment especially designed to ensure real time tracking      Since pilot error accounts for between one third and     of aviation accidents  advances in automation and technology could replace some or all of the duties of the aircraft pilots  Automation since the     s has already eliminated the need for flight engineers  In complex situations with severely degraded systems  the problem solving and judgement capability of humans is challenging to achieve with automated systems  for example the catastrophic engine failures experienced by United Airlines Flight     and Qantas Flight         However  with more accurate software modeling of aeronautic factors  test planes have been successfully flown in these conditions      While the accident rate is very low  to ensure they do not rise with the air transport growth  experts recommend creating a robust culture

For seafaring  see maritime resource management  Not to be confused with Crew management   Crew resource management or cockpit resource management  CRM        is a set of training procedures for use in environments where human error can have devastating effects  CRM is primarily used for improving aviation safety  and focuses on interpersonal communication  leadership  and decision making in aircraft cockpits  Its founder is David Beaty  a former Royal Air Force and a BOAC pilot who wrote The Human Factor in Aircraft Accidents         Despite the considerable development of electronic aids since then  many principles he developed continue to prove effective  CRM in the US formally began with a National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  recommendation written by NTSB Air Safety Investigator and aviation psychologist Alan Diehl    during his investigation of the      United Airlines Flight     crash  The issues surrounding that crash included a DC   crew running out of fuel over Portland  Oregon  while troubleshooting a landing gear problem     The term  cockpit resource management  which was later amended to  crew resource management  because it was important to include all the aircraft crew  rather than just the pilots and engineers as first conceived   was coined in      by NASA psychologist John Lauber  who for several years had studied communication processes in cockpits     While retaining a command hierarchy  the concept was intended to foster a less authoritarian cockpit culture in which co pilots are encouraged to question captains if they observed them making mistakes     CRM grew out of the      Tenerife airport disaster  in which two Boeing     aircraft collided on the runway  killing     people  A few weeks later  NASA held a workshop on the topic  endorsing this training     In the US  United Airlines was the first airline to launch a comprehensive CRM program  starting in          By the     s  CRM had become a global standard     United Airlines trained their flight attendants to use CRM in conjunction with the pilots to provide another layer of enhanced communication and teamwork  Studies have shown the use of CRM by both work groups reduces communication barriers and problems can be solved more effectively  leading to increased safety     CRM training concepts have been modified for use in a wide range of activities including air traffic control  ship handling  firefighting  and surgery  in which people must make dangerous  time critical decisions       Overview edit  This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section  Unsourced material may be challenged and removed   December        Learn how and when to remove this message  The current generic term  crew resource management   CRM  has been widely adopted but is also known as cockpit resource management  flightdeck resource management  and command  leadership and resource management  When CRM techniques are applied to other arenas  they are sometimes given unique labels  such as maintenance resource management  bridge and engine room resource management  BRM  ERM   or maritime resource management  CRM training encompasses a wide range of knowledge  skills  and attitudes including communications  situational awareness  problem solving  decision making  and teamwork  together with all the attendant sub disciplines which each of these areas entails  CRM can be defined as a system that uses resources to promote safety within the workplace  CRM is concerned with the cognitive and interpersonal skills needed to manage resources within an organized system rather than with the technical knowledge and skills required to operate equipment  In this context  cognitive skills are defined as the mental processes used for gaining and maintaining situational awareness  for solving problems and for making decisions  Interpersonal skills are regarded as communications and a range of behavioral activities associated with teamwork  In many operational systems  skill areas often overlap and are not confined to multi crew craft or equipment  and relate to single operator equipment or craft  Aviation organizations including major airlines and military aviation have introduced CRM training for crews  CRM training is now a mandated requirement for commercial pilots working under most regulatory bodies  including the FAA  US  and EASA  Europe   The NOTECHS system is used to evaluate non technical skills  Following the lead of the commercial airline industry  the US Department of Defense began training its air crews in CRM in the mid     s      The U S  Air Force and U S  Navy require all air crew members to receive annual CRM training to reduce human error caused mishaps          The U S  Army has its own version of CRM called Aircrew Coordination Training Enhanced  ACT E        Case studies edit  United Airlines Flight     edit  When the crew of United Airlines Flight     was making an approach to Portland International Airport on the evening of Dec           they experienced a landing gear abnormality  The captain decided to enter a holding pattern so they could troubleshoot the problem  The captain focused on the landing gear problem for an hour  ignoring repeated hints from the first officer and the flight engineer about their dwindling fuel supply  and only realized the situation when the engines began flaming out  The aircraft crash landed in a suburb of Portland  Oregon  over six miles     km  short of the runway  Of the     people aboard  two crew members and eight passengers died  The NTSB Air Safety Investigator Alan Diehl wrote in his report   Issue an operations bulletin to all air carrier operations inspectors directing them to urge their assigned operators to ensure that their flightcrews are indoctrinated in principles of flightdeck resource management  with particular emphasis on the merits of participative management for captains and assertiveness training for other cockpit crewmembers   Class II  Priority Action   X           Diehl    was assigned to investigate this accident and realized it was similar to several other major airline accidents including the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight         and the runway collision between Pan Am and KLM Boeing    s at Tenerife       United Airlines Flight     edit  Captain Al Haynes  pilot of United Airlines Flight      credits CRM as being one of the factors that saved his own life  and many others  in the Sioux City  Iowa crash of July             the preparation that paid off for the crew was something     called Cockpit Resource Management     Up until       we kind of worked on the concept that the captain was THE authority on the aircraft  What he said  goes  And we lost a few airplanes because of that  Sometimes the captain isn t as smart as we thought he was  And we would listen to him  and do what he said  and we wouldn t know what he s talking about  And we had     years of flying experience there in the cockpit  trying to get that airplane on the ground  not one minute of which we had actually practiced  under those failure conditions   any one of us  So why would I know more about getting that airplane on the ground under those conditions than the other three  So if I hadn t used  CRM   if we had not let everybody put their input in  it s a cinch we wouldn t have made it      Air France     edit  One analysis blames failure to follow proper CRM procedures as being a contributing factor that led to the      fatal crash into the Atlantic Ocean of Air France Flight     from Rio de Janeiro to Paris  The final report concluded the aircraft crashed after temporary inconsistencies between the airspeed measurements likely due to the aircraft s pitot tubes being obstructed by ice crystals caused the autopilot to disconnect  after which the crew reacted incorrectly  causing the aircraft to enter an aerodynamic stall from which it did not recover      Following recovery of the black box two years later  independent analyses were published before and after the official report was issued by the BEA  France s air safety board  One was a French report in the book  Erreurs de Pilotage  written by Jean Pierre Otelli                  which leaked the final minutes of recorded cockpit conversation  According to Popular Mechanics  which examined the cockpit conversation just before the crash   The men are utterly failing to engage in an important process known as crew resource management  or CRM  They are failing  essentially  to cooperate  It is not clear to either one of them who is responsible for what  and who is doing what      First Air Flight      edit  The Canadian Transportation Safety Board  CTSB  determined a failure of crew resource management was largely responsible for the crash of First Air Flight       a Boeing          in Resolute  Nunavut  on August           A malfunctioning compass gave the crew an incorrect heading  although the instrument landing system and Global Positioning System indicated they were off course  The first officer made several attempts to indicate the problem to the captain but a failure to follow airline procedures and a lack of a standardized communication protocol to indicate a problem led to the captain dismissing the first officer s warnings  Both pilots were also overburdened with making preparations to land  resulting in neither being able to pay full attention to what was happening  First Air increased the time dedicated to CRM in their training as a result of the accident  and the CTSB recommended regulatory bodies and airlines to standardize CRM procedures and training in Canada                       Qantas Flight    edit  The success of the Qantas Flight    flight has been attributed to teamwork and CRM skills      Susan Parson  the editor of the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  Safety Briefing wrote   Clearly  the QF   crew s performance was a bravura example of the professionalism and airmanship every aviation citizen should aspire to emulate       Carey Edwards  author of Airmanship  wrote   Their crew performance  communications  leadership  teamwork  workload management  situation awareness  problem solving and decision making resulted in no injuries to the     passengers and crew  QF   will remain as one of the finest examples of airmanship in the history of aviation          Adoption in other fields edit  Transportation edit  The basic concepts and ideology of CRM have proven successful in other related fields  In the     s  several commercial aviation firms and international aviation safety agencies began expanding CRM into air traffic control  aircraft design  and aircraft maintenance  The aircraft maintenance section of this training expansion gained traction as maintenance resource management  MRM   To attempt to standardize industry wide MRM training  the FAA issued Advisory Circular          Maintenance Resource Management Training  in September           Following a study of aviation mishaps between      and       the United States Air Force determined that close to     of its aircraft mishaps were directly attributable to human error in maintenance      which often occurred long before the flight in which the problems were discovered  These  latent errors  include failures to follow published aircraft manuals  lack of assertive communication among maintenance technicians  poor supervision  and improper assembly practices  In       to address these human error induced aircraft mishaps  Lt Col Doug Slocum  Chief of Safety at the Air National Guard s  ANG     nd Fighter Wing  Tucson  directed the modification of the base s CRM program into a military version called maintenance resource management  MRM   citation needed  In mid       the Air National Guard s Aviation Safety Division converted Slocum s MRM program into a national program available to the Air National Guard s flying wings in    U S  states and territories  In       the Defense Safety Oversight Council  DSOC  of the U S  Department of Defense  DoD  recognized the mishap prevention value of this maintenance safety program by partially funding a variant of ANG MRM for training throughout the U S  Air Force  This ANG initiated  DoD funded version of MRM became known as Air Force Maintenance Resource Management  AF MRM  and is now widely used in the U S  Air Force      The Rail Safety Regulators Panel of Australia has adapted CRM to rail as rail resource management and developed a free resource kit      Operating train crews at the National Railroad Passenger Corporation  Amtrak  in the United States are instructed on CRM principles during yearly training courses  citation needed  CRM has been adopted by merchant shipping worldwide  The STCW Convention and STCW Code       edition      published by the I M O  states the requirements for bridge resource management and engine room resource management training  These are approved shore based training  simulator training  or approved in service experience  Most maritime colleges hold courses for deck and engine room officers  Refresher courses are held every five years  These are referred to as maritime resource management   Firefighting edit  Following its successful use in aviation training  CRM was identified as a potential safety improvement program for the fire services  Ted Putnam advocated for improved attention to human factors that contribute to accidents and near misses  building on CRM principles      In       Dr  Putnam organized the first Human Factors Workshop for wildland fire          Dr  Putnam also wrote a paper that applied CRM concepts to the violent deaths of    Wildland firefighters on the South Canyon Fire in Colorado  citation needed  From this paper  a movement was initiated in the Wildland and Structural Fire Services to apply CRM concepts to emergency response situations  Various programs have since been developed to train emergency responders in these concepts and to help track breakdowns in these stressful environments  citation needed  The International Association of Fire Chiefs published its first CRM manual for the fire service in       It is currently when   in its third edition      Several industry specific textbooks have also been published  citation needed   Healthcare edit  Elements of CRM have been applied in US healthcare since the late     s  specifically in infection prevention  For example  the  central line bundle  of best practices recommends using a checklist when inserting a central venous catheter  The observer checking off the checklist is usually lower ranking than the person inserting the catheter  The observer is encouraged to communicate when elements of the bundle are not executed  for example if a breach in sterility has occurred       Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety  TeamSTEPPS  edit  The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  AHRQ   a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services  also provides training based on CRM principles to healthcare teams  This training  called Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety  TeamSTEPPS   and the program is currently when   being implemented in hospitals  long term care facilities  and primary care clinics around the world      TeamSTEPPs was designed to improve patient safety by teaching healthcare providers how to better collaborate with each other by using tools such as huddles  debriefs  handoffs  and check backs          Implementing TeamSTEPPS has been shown to improve patient safety      There is evidence TeamSTEPPS interventions are difficult to implement and are not universally effective      There are strategies healthcare leaders can use to improve their chance of implementation success  such as using coaching  supporting  empowering  and supporting behaviors       See also edit  British European Airways Flight     The Checklist Manifesto   primarily a justification of the

Threat management  computer security   Threat and error management model In aviation safety  threat and error management  TEM  is an overarching safety management approach that assumes that pilots will naturally make mistakes and encounter risky situations during flight operations  Rather than try to avoid these threats and errors  its primary focus is on teaching pilots to manage these issues so they do not impair safety  Its goal is to maintain safety margins by training pilots and flight crews to detect and respond to events that are likely to cause damage  threats  as well as mistakes that are most likely to be made  errors  during flight operations     TEM allows crews to measure the complexities of a specific organization s context   meaning that the threats and errors encountered by pilots will vary depending upon the type of flight operation   and record human performance in that context     TEM also considers technical  e g  mechanical  and environmental issues  and incorporates strategies from Crew Resource Management to teach pilots to manage threats and errors  The TEM framework was developed in      by psychologists at University of Texas based on the investigation of accidents of high capacity Regular Public Transport  RPT  airlines     However  an evaluation method was needed to identify threats and errors during flight operations and to add information to existing TEM data        A Line Operations Safety Audit  LOSA  serves this purpose and involves the identification and collection of safety related information   on crew performance  environmental conditions  and operational complexity   by a highly trained observer        LOSA data is used to assess the effectiveness of an organization s training program and to find out how trained procedures are being implemented in day to day flights    Importance of TEM edit  Threat and error management is an important element in the training of competent pilots that can effectively manage in flight challenges        Many strategies have been developed  e g  training  teamwork  reallocating workload  that were focused on improving on stress  fatigue  and error  Flight crew training stressed the importance of operational procedures and technical knowledge  with less emphasis placed on nontechnical skills  which became isolated from the real world operational contexts     Safety training  including TEM  is important because a crew s nontechnical  safety  knowledge helps more in managing errors effectively than crews  familiarization with operations through experience     Candidates who are shortlisted during selection and training processes must demonstrate analytical and coordination capabilities     Possessing these nontechnical skills allows pilots and crew members to carry out their duties efficiently and effectively   Components of TEM edit  The following components are methods that help provide data for the TEM   LOSA observation training edit  Training for LOSA experts includes two sessions  education in procedural protocols  and TEM concepts and classifications      A LOSA trainee is taught to find data first and then code them later for both sessions  during which a crew member must exhibit  LOSA Etiquette    ability to notify the pilot as to why he or she was not able to detect an error or threat after a flight  The pilot s responsibilities include his or her opinions on what safety issues could have had an adverse impact on their operations  A LOSA trainee must then record the specific responses of the pilot and thereafter code performance using behavioral markers  The order of the recording is as follows  a  record visible threats  b  identify error types  crew s responses  and specific outcomes  and c  use CRM behavioral markers to rate crew      Observers will finally record a pilot s overall response on a   point Likert scale     poor     marginal     good  and    outstanding  The data are then quantified and tabulated as exemplified by the following format      Planning and execution of performance    Task Task Description Comments Rating   Monitor cross check Active monitoring of crews Situational awareness maintained Outstanding   SOP briefing Carried out necessary briefings Thorough understanding of procedures   Contingency Management Communicate strategies Good management of threats and errors     Identified Threats Managed Mismanaged  Frequency  N    Air Traffic Control           Airline Operational Pressure         Weather         Frequency is the total number of threats that occurred and is denoted by N   Categories of the LOSA edit  LOSA identifies three main categories that must be recorded   Errors include procedural errors  mistakes or inadequacy of attention towards a task at hand   and violation of SOP  intentional or unintentional   Crew members are encouraged not to be afraid of admitting their mistakes  they must be able to criticize themselves since the learning process helps them understand the potential danger presented other crew members     Undesired Aircraft States are aircraft configurations or circumstances that are caused either by human error or by external factors      The management of unintended states is vital since they can result in serious aircraft accidents  For example  navigation problems on the cockpit display may lead a pilot to make an incorrect decisions  potentially causing injuries or fatality to passengers and crew members alike  Safety change process edit  Safety change process  SCP   which is part of LOSA  is a formal mechanism that airlines can use to identify active and latent threats to flight operations      It is a guideline that communicates in detail what is an imminent threat to current operations or who is causing the threat  In the past  SCP data were based on investigation of accidents or incidents  experiences  and intuitions but nowadays SCP focuses more on the precursors to accidents      There are several steps involved in conducting SCP         Safety Change Process  SCP  model        Collect safety issues  LOSA expert    Conduct detailed analysis of Risks data   Identify improvement strategies     Revise any changesSafety Change Process   Risk Analysis     Observe the impact of changes   Apply changes to operations   Funding of changes   An unnamed airline conducted base line observations from      to      using the defined SCP and LOSA data to improve its organization s safety culture and the results were positive  The crew error trapping rate was significantly increased to      meaning that crews were able to detect about     of the errors they caused      A     reduction in errors related to checklist performance and a     reduction in unstabilized approaches  tailstrikes  controlled flight into terrain  runway excursions  etc   were observed      A proper review and management of SCP and LOSA data can prevent further disasters in flight operations   See also edit  Accident Classification Aviation safety Crew Resource Management Pilot Error Error Management The curse of expertise References edit      a b c Dekker

January        Learn how and when to remove this message  The Aviation Safety Reporting System  or ASRS  is the US Federal Aviation Administration s  FAA  voluntary confidential reporting system that allows pilots  air traffic controllers  cabin crew  dispatchers  maintenance technicians  ground operations  and UAS operators and drone flyers to confidentially report near misses or close call events in the interest of improving aviation safety  The ASRS collects  analyzes  and responds to voluntarily submitted aviation safety incident reports in order to reduce the likelihood of aviation accidents     The ASRS was designed and is operated by NASA  who is seen as a neutral third party due to its lack of enforcement authority and relations with airlines  The confidential and independent nature of the ASRS is key to its long term success in identifying numerous latent system hazards in the National Airspace System  NAS   The FAA extends limited immunity to individual aviation workers for reporting safety events which do not result in an accident  as defined by the FAA  This has the effect of encouraging these potential reporters to come forward with systemic safety issues without fear of reprisal  The success of the system stands as a positive example used as a model by other industries seeking to make improvements in safety  Other industries who have modeled similar systems on the ASRS include the rail  medical  firefighters  and off shore petroleum production    Reporting process edit  A notable feature of the ASRS is its confidentiality and immunity policy     Reporters may  but are not required to  submit their name and contact information  If the ASRS staff has questions regarding a report  it can perform a callback and request further information or clarification from the reporter  Once the staff is satisfied with the information received  the report is stripped of identifying information and assigned a report number  The part of the reporting form with contact information is detached and returned to the reporter  ASRS will issue alerts to relevant parties  such as airlines  air traffic controllers  manufacturers  and airport authorities if NASA considers the issue to be significant to improved aviation safety  The ASRS also publishes a monthly newsletter highlighting safety issues  and now has an online database of reports that is accessible by the public  This database makes a large body of de identified reports available to safety researchers world wide  In addition  the ASRS occasionally conducts special studies on topics of interest to researchers and regulators  These special studies are also made available on the ASRS website   Immunity policy edit  The first government official to advocate the use of an immunity policy was Bobbie R  Allen  Director of the Civil Aeronautics Board  In        twelve years before ASRS was launched  Bobbie R  Allen  Director of the Bureau of Aviation Safety  was advocating the use of computers and the concept of non punitive incident reporting        In a Nov      speech at a Flight Safety Foundation seminar in Madrid  Allen stated     We must find a way of moving this raw material for accident prevention to the processing machine   He further stated   What is it  then  that stands in the way of communicating this incident information to the appropriate governmental agency for processing  Repeatedly  when this question is asked  one hears the reply FEAR  fear of litigation  fear of regulation  fear of punitive action       Often  reports are submitted because a rule was accidentally broken  The FAA s immunity policy encourages submission of all safety incidents and observations  especially information that could prevent a major accident  even if a violation occurs  If enforcement action is taken by the FAA against an accidental rule violation that did not result in an accident  a reporter can present their ASRS ID strip as proof that the incident was reported to NASA in the interest of aviation safety  Reporters do not have to share their report with the FAA and NASA will not share the report with the FAA   The FAA considers the submission of the report as evidence of a  constructive attitude  and will not impose a penalty      However  this immunity can only be exercised once every five years  though an unlimited number of reports can be filed   Statistical validity edit  Due to the self selected  or voluntary nature of the reports to the ASRS  NASA cautions against statistical use of the data they contain  On the other hand  they do express considerable confidence in the reliability of the reports submitted    However  the ASRS can say with certainty that its database provides definitive lower bound estimates of the frequencies at which various types of aviation safety events actually occur  For example         altitude overshoots were reported to the ASRS from January      through December       It can be confidently concluded that at least this number of overshoots occurred during the         period  and probably many more  Often  such lower bound estimates are all that decision makers need to determine that a problem exists and requires attention      History edit  The need for a system of recording and cataloging aviation safety s institutional knowledge and shared history was apparent long before ASRS came to fruition   In testimony before the U S  Senate on legislation proposing the Federal Aviation Act of       United Airlines president William A  Patterson touched the concept   On the positive side   said Mr  Patterson   you take your statistics    and your records   and your exposures   and you act before the happening   citation needed  Several years later  speaking before a Flight Safety Foundation International Air Safety Seminar in Madrid in November       Bobbie R  Allen  the Director of the Bureau of Safety of the U S  Civil Aeronautics Board  referred to the vast body of accumulated aviation safety incident information as a  sleeping giant   Noting that fear of legal liability and of regulatory or disciplinary action had prevented the dissemination of this information  rendering it valueless to those who might use it to combat hazards in the aviation system  Mr  Allen commented      In the event that the fear of exposure cannot be overcome by other means  it might be profitable if we explored a system of incident reporting which would assure a substantial flow of vital information to the computer for processing  and at the same time  would provide some method designed to effectively eliminate the personal aspect of the individual occurrences so that the information derived would be helpful to all and harmful to none   Bobbie R  Allen  Flight Safety

suitability for safe flight  Initial airworthiness is demonstrated by a certificate of airworthiness issued by the civil aviation authority in the state in which the aircraft is registered  and continuing airworthiness is achieved by performing the required maintenance actions     Certification is based on standards applied by civil aviation authorities  Interoperability is served when national benchmarks adopt standards from international civil and military organizations such as International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO   European Aviation Safety Agency  EASA   NATO and European Defence Agency  EDA   In the U S   Title     Code of Federal Regulations  Subchapter F  Part      states   a  No person may operate an aircraft unless it is in an airworthy condition   b  The pilot in command of a civil aircraft is responsible for determining whether that aircraft is in condition for safe flight   The pilot in command shall discontinue the flight when unairworthy mechanical  electrical  or structural conditions occur which compromise the airworthiness     Jurisdictional heterogeneity edit  One airworthiness regulation is found in ICAO international standard of Annex   to Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation which defines  airworthy    in respect of an aircraft  engine  propeller or part there of   as  The status of an aircraft  engine  propeller or part when it conforms to its approved design and is in a condition for safe operation   The application of airworthiness defines the condition of an aircraft and its suitability for flight  in that it has been designed with engineering rigor  constructed  maintained and is expected to be operated to approved standards and limitations  by competent and approved individuals  who are acting as members of an approved organization and whose work is both certified as correct and accepted on behalf of the state of aircraft registry  Apart from this organization  there are other ones like Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  or EASA that establish their own rules  In the case of the FAA  the regulation of airworthiness is found in Title    in the collected Code of Federal Regulations  The EASA specifications are found in several regulations  as n            Basic Regulations   n            Initial Airworthiness   n            Additional specifications about airworthiness  and n             Continuing airworthiness       European Regulation edit  In the regulation  UE  n           common rules in the aviation sector are established and created the European Aviation Safety Agency  Article   of this regulation details the first specifications about airworthiness  Article    is about airworthy certification     The main objective of these rules are to establish and to maintain a high and uniform security level at the civil aviation in Europe  For that reason  it lays down different rules according to the airworthiness   The jets will accomplish the essential  established requirements in annex I in airworthy section  It will be proved that the products possess a type certificate  Moreover  it is necessary to include modifications certificate of the same jet  This should be included in supplementary type certificate  Both of them may be sold when an applicant  proves that their product achieves the regulations  basis  No airplane can be operated without a valid certificate of airworthiness  C of A  A certificate of airworthiness will be issued when the applicant has demonstrated that the aircraft is conformed to the design of the model approved in its type certificate and that the pertinent documentation  inspections and tests confirm that the aircraft is in a condition for safe use  The certificate of airworthiness shall be valid as long as it is not canceled  or annulled  or is left without effect  provided that the aircraft is kept in accordance with the essential requirements for maintenance of airworthiness  The Commission will ensure  in particular  because the current state of the art and best practices in airworthiness are reflected  keep in mind the experience accumulated in service by aircraft throughout the world  as well as scientific and technical progress  allow immediate response  once the causes of accidents and serious incidents are determined  do not impose requirements on aircraft that are incompatible with the obligations assumed by the Member States by virtue of their belonging of the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO   Initial airworthiness edit  The Regulation  EU  No           establishes the dispositions of application on the airworthiness and environmental certification of aircraft and related products  components and equipment  as well as the certification of design and production organizations     Besides of the technical requirements and  common administratives procedures by the airworthiness and environmental certification  the following aspects can be found too in regulation n             The dispatch of type certificates  of restricted type certificates  of supplementary type certificates  as well as the modifications of said certificates  The dispatch of repair design approvals  The demonstration that environmental protection requirements are met  The dispatch of noise level certificates  The identification and certification of products  components and equipment  The certification of the design and production organizations  The dispatch of airworthiness directives  This regulation contains an annex  Part     which specifies the requirements and procedures for the certification of aircraft and related products  components and equipment  and design and production organizations  Apart from this annex  there are also several certification specifications  including CS     for large aircraft  and CS     for medium and small aircraft  In application  airworthiness standards include a probability of loss of aircraft  PLOA  that is designed to be controllable  PLOAdc  as an overall attribute     Setting a sufficiently robust PLOA factor for the aircraft s ability to safely attain  sustain  and terminate flight protects the souls on board   An aircraft safe enough to carry human life is presumed safe to fly over people on the ground   For  airworthiness regulations  that  serve to  protect  people  onboard  the  aircraft       the  protection  of  persons  and  property  on  the ground   is  another benefit       However  for unmanned aircraft  airworthiness must only address the safety of people on the ground and not the aircraft itself   This changes the assessment of risks and hazards  allowing a new approach that accounts for risk and consequence in the setting of airworthiness requirements   For military unmanned aircraft  France developed an unmanned unique airworthiness concept  later adapted by NATO  that isolates failures catastrophic to human life    The concept later came to be described as the  Cumulative Probability of all Catastrophic Failure Conditions  or  PCumCat    Here  two outcomes are addressed  First  an airworthiness issue arises from an uncontrolled crash  which is defined as a condition resulting from one or a combination of failure conditions that prevents the flight control system from controlling and maneuvering the aircraft until the impact on the ground AEP          page A     To be certified to fly over any population density  an hypothetical uncontrolled crash assumes that human life at the point of impact is lost  In the second outcome  a forced landing or recovery at a predefined and unpopulated area is defined as a condition resulting from one or a combination of failure conditions that prevents the UAV from landing on its planned main landing site  although the flight control system is still able to control and maneuver the UAV   see AEP       page   F     U       page A      While the aircraft may be lost  residual maneuverability directing to an unpopulated point of impact means this alternative is not catastrophic and therefore not an airworthiness factor   Though the aircraft may be lost or considered a hull loss  the flight has been safely terminated   Additional airworthiness specifications edit  The Regulation  EU  n           establishes additional airworthiness specifications for operations and contains two annexes  The Annex I  Part      Subpart A  is devoted to general provisions on the appropriate authority  temporarily inoperative equipment and demonstration of conformity  Subpart B of the aforementioned annex focuses on large aircraft and contains specifications related to seats  berths  seat belts and harnesses  location  access and markings of emergency exits  emergency interior lighting and operation of emergency lights  interiors hold  flammability of the coatings of cargo compartments  fire protection for toilets  acoustic warning of the landing gear and systems for opening and closing the flight crew compartment door   incapacitation of a crew member  Annex II contains an amendment to Annex III  part ORO  of Regulation  EU  No                Maintaining airworthiness edit  The Regulation  EU  No            controls the continuing of the airworthiness of aircraft and aeronautical products  components and equipment and the approval of the organizations and staff who involve in these tasks  It contains   annexes  although Annex V has been repealed  Annex I  Part M   Section A  Technical requirements    establishes the measures that must be taken to ensure the continuing of airworthiness  including maintenance  Moreover  it specifies the conditions that must be achieved by the people or organizations involved in the management of airworthiness maintenance   Section B  Procedures for the competent authority   establishes the administrative procedures to be followed by the competent authority for the application and enforcement of Section A of Part M      The Annex II  Part       Section A  Technical requirements    establishes the requirements which an organization must obey to be able to award or maintain a continuing approval of the elements and aircraft   The Section B  Procedures for Competent Administration   establishes the administrative procedures that must be followed by the competent authority to execute its tasks and responsibilities in connection with the concession  modification  suspension or revocation of approvals of maintenance organizations Part       The Annex III  Part      Section A  Technical requirements    define the aircraft continuing license and set the requirements for its application  dispatch and continuity of its validity   The Section B  Procedures for the competent authority   establishes the procedures  requirements  administrative requirements  measurement and control of compliance with Section A of Part      The Annex IV  Part       Section A  Technical requirements    establishes the requirements that must be fulfilled by the organizations that request authorization to carry out training courses and specific examinations in Part      Section B  Procedures for competent administration   establishes the administrative requirements that must be followed by the competent authorities for the application of section A of this part   The Annex V bis  Part T   Section A  Technical requirements    establishes the requirements to ensure maintenance of the continuing airworthiness of the aircraft referred to in Article    letter b   in accordance with the fundamental requirements set out in Annex IV of the Regulations  EC  No            The conditions to be had by the people and organizations responsible for managing the maintenance of airworthiness and the maintenance of the aircraft in question are also specified   The Section B  Procedures for Competent Authorities   establishes the administrative procedures that must be followed by the competent authorities in charge of the application and compliance of Section A of Part T   The Annex VI contains a table of correspondence between Regulation  EC  No            and these regulations   FAA regulations edit  The USA Federal Aviation Regulations  Part             d  has a procedural definition of airworthy   other aircraft An applicant for a standard airworthiness certificate for aircraft not covered by paragraphs  a  through  c   a  New aircraft manufactured under a production certificate   b  New aircraft manufactured under type certificate only   c  Import aircraft    of this section is entitled to a standard airworthiness certificate if         He presents evidence to the Administrator that the aircraft conforms to a type design approved under a type certificate or a supplemental type certificate and to applicable Airworthiness Directives       The aircraft  except an experimentally certificated aircraft that previously had been issued a different airworthiness certificate under this section  has been inspected in accordance with the performance rules for     hour inspections set forth in part       of this chapter and found airworthy by    i The manufacturer   ii The holder of a repair station certificate as provided in part     of this chapter   iii The holder of a mechanic certificate as authorized in part    of this chapter   v The holder of a certificate issued under part     of this chapter  and having a maintenance and inspection organization appropriate to the aircraft type  and    The Administrator finds after inspection  that the aircraft conforms to the type design  and is in condition for safe operation   An example of an aircraft that was not legally airworthy is the one used in the Lawnchair Larry flight in       The definition of the term  Airworthy  was never included in the Code of Federal Regulations until the    CFR Part    General Requirements  was established   The definition was included in the guidance  such as Advisory Circulars and Orders  but never in the Rule   Part   defines an Airworthy aircraft as one that conforms to its type design and is in a condition for safe flight  A more generic and non process oriented definition of airworthiness is in JSP    Military Airworthiness Regulations        Edition   Change    The ability of an aircraft or other airborne equipment or system to operate without significant hazard to aircrew  ground crew  passengers  where relevant  or to the general public over which such airborne systems are flown This definition applies equally to civil and military aircraft      An example of a method used to delineate  significant hazard  is a risk reduction technique used by the military and used widely throughout engineering known as ALARP  As Low As Reasonably Practicable    This is defined as   The principle  used in the application of the Health and Safety at Work Act  that safety should be improved beyond the baseline criteria so far as is reasonably practicable   A risk is ALARP when it has been demonstrated that the cost of any further Risk reduction  where cost includes the loss of capability as well as financial or other resource costs  is grossly disproportionate to the benefit obtained from that Risk reduction   In the U S  Code of Federal Regulations  Title     Part               states  for the purposes of this part  the following definition applies    Continued safe flight and landing means an airplane is capable of continued controlled flight and landing  possibly using emergency procedures  without requiring exceptional pilot skill or strength  Upon landing  some airplane damage may occur as a result of a failure condition    Canadian regulations edit  In Canada Canadian Aviation Regulations  CAR

encyclopedia   Redirected from Type certification  Document noting the airworthiness of a certain type of aircraft Sample type certificate issued by the USA FAA for the DC   aeroplane A type certificate signifies the airworthiness of a particular category of aircraft  according to its manufacturing design  type design   Certification confirms that the aircraft of a new type intended for serial production is in compliance with applicable airworthiness requirements established by the national air law     For up to three seats  primary category aircraft certification costs around US   million  US    million for a general aviation aircraft and hundreds of millions of dollars for a commercial aircraft  certification delays can cost millions of dollars and can decide a program s profitability       Authority edit  A type certificate  TC  is issued to signify the airworthiness of the approved design or  type  of an aircraft to be manufactured  The TC is issued by a regulatory authority  and once issued  the design cannot be changed unless at least part of the process for certification is repeated to cover the changes  The TC reflects a determination made by a regulatory authority that the type design is in compliance with airworthiness requirements     Examples of regulatory authorities are the United Kingdom s Civil Aviation Authority  CAA   the U S  Federal Aviation Administration  FAA   the European Aviation Safety Agency  EASA   Transport Canada  Brazil s Ag ncia Nacional de Avia  o Civil and the Civil Aviation Administration of China  CAAC   When changes are needed to an airframe or on board equipment  there are two options  One is to initiate a modification by the type design holder  manufacturer   and the other is to request a third party Supplemental type certificate  STC   The choice is determined by considering whether or not the change constitutes a new design  i e  introduces risk not considered in the first type design   If so  then type design holder must develop and approve a modification to the type design  If the regulatory authority agrees the change does not introduce new risk  the STC option is available  An STC is less expensive because the design change can be developed by a specialized design organization  a generally more flexible and efficient process than going through the original manufacturer  The STC defines the product design change  states how the modification affects the existing type design  and lists serial numbers of the aircraft affected  It also identifies the certification basis for regulatory compliance for the design change     The TC implies that aircraft manufactured according to the approved design can be issued an airworthiness certificate  To meet those requirements the aircraft and each sub assembly must also be approved  For example  in the U S  these sub assemblies must meet requirements in the applicable Technical Standards Order  TSO   To meet those requirements the design documents are examined for compliance with the applicable Minimum Operating Performance Standards  MOPS  applicable to that sub assembly  MOPS are published by expert industry groups such as  RTCA Inc   EUROCAE  and SAE  When aircraft are produced to meet a given TC  each one need not be tested as rigorously but the confidence demonstrated by the TC is conferred  when the aircraft has been assigned a certificate of airworthiness  CoA   A CoA is issued for each aircraft that is properly registered if it conforms to its type design and ready for safe operation  The CoA is valid and the aircraft may be operated as long as it is maintained in accordance with the rules issued by the regulatory authority   History edit  The Buhl Verville CA   Airster the first US type certificated aircraft The concept of a  type certificate  was introduced by the  Air Navigation Regulations  published in May      by the UK s Secretary of State for Air  Winston Churchill     The Buhl Verville CA   Airster was the first aircraft to receive a type certificate in the US         i e  A T C  No     issued by the Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce on March               Aircraft type certification edit  Prototype edit  Test equipment on board the A     very large aeroplane prototype intended for certification flight testing Initially  the applicant design organisation submits documents to their local aviation regulating body  detailing how the proposed aircraft type design would fulfill the airworthiness requirements  After investigations by the regulator  the final approval of such documents  after the required comments and amendments in order to fulfill the laws   becomes the basis of the certification  The firm follows it and draws a proposed timetable of actions required for certification tests  With the application  the regulations to be applied will usually be frozen for this application for a given amount of time in order to avoid a situation where the applicant would have to change the design as a result of changed regulation  An initial design sample known as a prototype is built  This refers to either the aircraft  the engines or the propeller  depending on the basis of the certification  For the purpose of illustration  the discussion shall be limited to the aircraft  Normally a few prototypes are built  each subject to different tests  The prototypes are first used for ground and system tests  One of the prototypes  known as the  static airframe   is subject to destructive testing  i e   the prototype is subject to stress beyond normal and abnormal operations until destruction   The test results are compared with initial submitted calculations to establish the ultimate structural strength  Other prototypes will undergo other systems tests until the satisfaction of the regulators  With all ground tests completed  prototypes are made ready for flight tests  The flight tests are flown by specially approved flight test pilots who will fly the prototypes to establish the ultimate flight limits which should be within the airworthiness rules  If a long range airliner is tested  the flight tests may cover the whole world  Tests may also cover different environments   high and low altitude  freezing and hot climates  and so on  to confirm correct performance throughout the aircraft s design envelope  In parallel with aircraft testing  the applicant firm also draws up maintenance program to support continuous airworthiness after approval of the design  The program is drawn with inputs from tests results and also from initial customers  engineering departments  The proposed maintenance program is submitted to the regulators for comment and approval  After successful completion of ground and flight tests  along with an approved maintenance program  the prototype is approved  and the firm is granted the TC for the prototype  as understood that it should include all furnished equipment for its intended role   The legal term for the firm is now the  type certificate holder   Subsequently  the prototype now serves as a template for serial aircraft production and the aircraft rolling out of the factory should be identical to the prototype within the frames outlined in a TC data sheet  and each given a serial number  a  series aircraft     Continuing airworthiness edit  Aircraft maintenance edit  Transaero Boeing     undergoing C check maintenance at the British Airways Engineering maintenance base        As the aircraft enters into service  it is subject to operational wear and tear which may cause performance degradations  The set of processes by which an aircraft  engine  propeller or part complies with the applicable airworthiness requirements and remains in a condition for safe operation throughout its operating life called continuing airworthiness  A maintenance program is issued by the aircraft operator and approved by the regulatory authority of the state of registry to maintain the airworthiness of the aircraft of the type owned by the operator  Maintenance tasks outlined in the maintenance program have to be scheduled and timely accomplished in order for the airworthiness certificate of their aircraft to remain valid     Other continuing airworthiness activities include additional tasks associated with the maintenance program and design changes to be accomplished via   Airworthiness directives  ADs  Service bulletins  SBs  Airworthiness directives edit  Sometimes during service  the aircraft may encounter problems that may compromise the aircraft s safety  which are not anticipated or detected in prototype testing stages  The aircraft design is thus compromised  The regulators will now issue an airworthiness directive to the type certificate holder and to all owners globally  The directives normally consists of additional maintenance or design actions that are necessary to restore the type s airworthiness  Compliance is mandatory and thus if an operator does not comply with an AD  then the datum aircraft is not considered airworthy and further operation of the affected aircraft type would be unlawful  making the operator liable to legal action by the relevant national aviation authority  and rendering null and void any of the operator s insurance policies relating to the type  such as hull loss and accident third party coverage  ADs may also be raised with changes of the local or global aviation rules and requirements  e g   the requirement to fit armored cockpit doors for all passenger airliners after the September    attacks  The certifying authority issues an AD when an unsafe condition is found to exist in a product  aircraft  aircraft engine  propeller  or appliance  of a particular type design  ADs are used by the certifying authority to notify aircraft owners and operators of unsafe conditions and to require their correction  ADs prescribe the conditions and limitations  including inspection  repair  or alteration under which the product may continue to be operated   Service bulletins edit  With increasing in service experience  the type certificate holder may find ways to improve the original design resulting in either lower maintenance costs or increased performance  These improvements  normally involving some alterations  are suggested through service bulletins to an aircraft owners operators as optional  and may be extra cost  items  The owner operator shall exercise their discretion whether or not to incorporate the bulletins and report  the decision to the regulatory authority of the state of the aircraft registry  Sometimes SBs can become mandated by relevant ADs   Changes to type certificate edit  Often the basic design is enhanced further by the type certificate holder  Major changes beyond the authority of the service bulletins require amendments to the type certificate  For example  increasing  or decreasing  an aircraft s flight performance  range and load carrying capacity by altering its systems  fuselage  wings or engines resulting in a new variant may require re certification  Again the basic process of type certifications is repeated  including maintenance programs   However  unaltered items from the basic design need not be retested  Normally  one or two of the original prototype fleet are remanufactured to the new proposed design  As long as the new design does not deviate too much from the original  static airframes do not need to be built  The resultant new prototypes are again subjected to flight tests  Upon successful completion of the certification program  the original type certificate is amended to include the new variant  normally denoted by a new model number additional to the original type designation   Typical examples are  the Boeing    NG                            and          which replaced the     Original family          and          and the     Classic family                   and          and the Airbus A        and the A        which is based on the Airbus A        and the A          Supplementary supplemental type certificate  STC  edit  Main article  Supplemental type certificate Any additions  omissions or alterations to the aircraft s certified layout  built in equipment  airframe and engines  initiated by any party other than the type certificate holder  need an approved supplementary   supplemental  in FAA terminology  type certificate  or STC  The scope of an STC can be extremely narrow or broad  It could include minor modifications to passenger cabin items or installed instruments  More substantial modifications may involve engine replacement  as in the Blackhawk modifications to Cessna Conquest and Beechcraft King Air turboprops  or a complete role change for the aircraft  such as converting a B    or Stearman into an agricultural aircraft  STCs are applied due to either the type certificate holder s refusal  frequently due to economics  or its inability to meet some owners  requirements  STCs are frequently raised for out of production aircraft types conversions to fit new roles  Before STCs are issued  procedures similar to type certificate changes for new variants are followed  likely including thorough flight tests  STCs belong to the STC holder and are generally more restrictive than type certificate changes   Validity edit  The TC holder remains responsible for the continued integrity of the approved aircraft type design and must continue to be the focal point for resolving issues that may require corrective action  This requires the continued capability  or access to a capability  of providing appropriate technical solutions for service difficulties or mandatory corrective action  If the holder is no longer capable or if the TC is transferred to another holder a regulatory authority should take appropriate action in accordance with the national legislation  In the case of the TC being transferred to another holder the  new holder shall be capable of fulfilling the TC holder responsibilities in following ADs and providing technical support to keep the type design current with the applicable airworthiness requirements  even after the production of the aircraft type has stopped but many out of production aircraft continue useful lives  STCs are also bound by the same rules  When the holder decides to stop supporting the aircraft type without the transfer of TC holder responsibilities  the TC is returned to the issuing regulatory authority and the remaining aircraft fleet can be grounded by the current states of registry until further decisions on the registered aircraft continuing airworthiness     In this manner the whole Concorde fleet was finally grounded when Airbus SAS surrendered its TC   See also edit

on aircraft  An airworthiness directive  commonly abbreviated as AD  is a notification to owners and operators of certified aircraft that a known safety deficiency with a particular model of aircraft  engine  avionics or other system exists and must be corrected        If a certified aircraft has outstanding airworthiness directives that have not been complied with  the aircraft is not considered airworthy        Thus  it is mandatory for an aircraft operator to comply with an AD    Purpose edit  ADs usually result from service difficulty reporting by operators or from the results of aircraft accident investigations  They are issued either by the national civil aviation authority of the country of aircraft manufacture or of aircraft registration  When ADs are issued by the country of registration they are almost always coordinated with the civil aviation authority of the country of manufacture to ensure that conflicting ADs are not issued  In detail  the purpose of an AD is to notify aircraft owners   that the aircraft may have an unsafe condition  or    that the aircraft may not be in conformity with its basis of certification or of other conditions that affect the aircraft s airworthiness  or    that there are mandatory actions that must be carried out to ensure continued safe operation  or    that  in some urgent cases  the aircraft must not be flown until a corrective action plan is designed and carried out     ADs are mandatory in most jurisdictions and often contain dates or aircraft flying hours by which compliance must be completed  ADs may be divided into two categories      Those of an emergency nature requiring immediate compliance prior to further flight  and Those of a less urgent nature requiring compliance within a specified period of time  Issuance edit  ADs are issued by most civil aviation regulatory authorities  including   Civil Aviation Safety Authority  Australia  European Aviation Safety Agency Directorate General of Civil Aviation  India  Federal Aviation Administration  United States  Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand Transport Canada    National procedures edit  United States edit  The FAA issues ADs by three different processes      Standard AD process  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  NPRM   followed by a Final Rule Final Rule and Request for Comments Emergency airworthiness directives   issued without time for comment  This is only used issued  when an unsafe condition exists that requires immediate action by an owner operator   to rapidly correct an urgent safety of flight situation

this message    U S  Army Air Forces test pilot Lt  F W   Mike  Hunter wearing a flight suit in October      An aircraft pilot  or aviator  is an individual who controls an aircraft s flight by operating its directional controls  Other aircrew members  such as navigators and flight engineers  are also considered aviators because they assist in operating the aircraft s navigation and engine systems  Aircrew members like drone operators  flight attendants  mechanics  and ground crew are not classified as aviators  To recognize pilots  qualifications and responsibilities  most militaries and many airlines around the world award aviator badges to their pilots    Definition edit  The first recorded use of the term aviator  aviateur in French  was in       as a variation of aviation  from the Latin avis  meaning bird   coined in      by G  J  G  de La Landelle  fr  in Aviation Ou Navigation A rienne   Aviation or Air Navigation    The term aviatrix  aviatrice in French   now archaic  was formerly used for a female pilot  The term aviator  aviateur in French   now archaic  was formerly used for a male pilot  People who operate aircraft obtain a pilot licence  Aviation regulations referred to pilots  These terms were used more in the early days of aviation  when airplanes were extremely rare  and connoted bravery and adventure  For example  a      reference work described the Wright brothers  first airplane   The weight  including the body of the aviator  is a little more than     pounds       History edit  This section needs expansion  You can help by adding to it    March       To ensure the safety of people in the air and on the ground  early aviation soon required that aircraft be under the operational control of a properly trained  certified pilot at all times  who is responsible for the safe and legal completion of the flight  The  A ro Club de France delivered the first certificate to Louis Bl riot in      followed by Glenn Curtiss  L on Delagrange  and Robert Esnault Pelterie  The British Royal Aero Club followed in      and the Aero Club of America in       Glenn Curtiss receiving the first    Civilian edit  Pilots landing a Boeing     Civilian pilots fly aircraft of all types privately for pleasure  charity  or in pursuance of a business  or commercially for non scheduled  charter  and scheduled passenger and cargo air carriers  airlines   corporate aviation  agriculture  crop dusting  etc    forest fire control  law enforcement  etc  When flying for an airline  pilots are usually referred to as airline pilots  with the pilot in command often referred to as the captain   Airline edit  There were         airline pilots in the world in      and aircraft simulator manufacturer CAE Inc  forecasts a need for         new ones for a population of         by               for growth and         to offset retirement and attrition         in Asia Pacific  average pilot age in            years          in Americas     years          in Europe       years  and        in Middle East   Africa       years      Boeing expects         new pilots in    years from               for commercial aviation         for business aviation and        for helicopters      in Asia Pacific                in North America                in Europe               in the Middle East              in Latin America              in Africa          and    in Russia  Central Asia              By November       due a shortage of qualified pilots  some pilots were leaving corporate aviation to return to airlines  In one example a Global      pilot  making          a year for    to    flight hours a month  returned to American Airlines with full seniority  A Gulfstream G    or Global      pilot might earn between          and           and recruiting one may require up to           At the other end of the spectrum  constrained by the available pilots  some small carriers hire new pilots who need     hours to jump to airlines in a year  They may also recruit non career pilots who have other jobs or airline retirees who want to continue to fly      Automation edit  The number of airline pilots could decrease as automation replaces copilots and eventually pilots as well  In January      Rhett Ross  CEO of Continental Motors said  my concern is that in the next two decades if not sooner automated and autonomous flight will have developed sufficiently to put downward pressure on both wages and the number and kind of flying jobs available  So if a kid asks the question now and he or she is        years from now will be      and our would be careerist will be    not even mid career  Who among us thinks aviation and especially for hire flying will look like it does now   Christian Dries  owner of Diamond Aircraft Austria said  Behind the curtain  aircraft manufacturers are working on a single pilot cockpit where the airplane can be controlled from the ground and only in case of malfunction does the pilot of the plane interfere  Basically the flight will be autonomous and I expect this to happen in the next five to six years for freighters   needs update     In August      financial company UBS predicted pilotless airliners are technically feasible and could appear around       offering around    bn of savings  mainly in pilot costs     bn for airlines    bn for business jets and     bn for civil helicopters    bn year from lower pilot training and aviation insurance costs due to safer flights    bn from flight optimisation     of global airlines      bn jet fuel bill in        not counting revenue opportunity from increased capacity utilization  Regulations have to adapt with air cargo likely at the forefront  but pilotless flights could be limited by consumer behaviour      of       people surveyed are defiant while     are supportive  with acceptation progressively forecast     AVweb reporter Geoff Rapoport stated   pilotless aircraft are an appealing prospect for airlines bracing for the need to hire several hundred thousand new pilots in the next decade  Wages and training costs have been rapidly rising at regional U S  airlines over the last several years as the major airlines have hired pilots from the regionals at unprecedented rates to cover increased air travel demand from economic expansion and a wave of retirements      Going to pilotless airliners could be done in one bold step or in gradual improvements like by reducing the cockpit crew for long haul missions or allowing single pilot cargo aircraft  The industry has not decided how to proceed yet  Present automated systems are not autonomous and must be monitored  their replacement could require artificial intelligence with machine learning while present certified software is deterministic     As the Airbus A    would only need minor modifications  Air Caraibes and French Bee parent Groupe Dubreuil see two pilot crews in long haul operations  without a third pilot for rotation  happening around               Single pilot freighters could start with regional flights      The Air Line Pilots Association believe removing pilots would threaten aviation safety and opposes the April      FAA Reauthorization Act s Section     establishing a research and development program to assist single pilot cargo aircraft by remote and computer piloting      For French aerospace research center Onera and avionics manufacturer Thales  artificial intelligence  AI  like consumer neural networks learning from large datasets cannot explain their operation and cannot be certified for safe air transport  Progress towards  explainable  AIs can be expected in the next decade  as the Onera expects  leads  for a certifiable AI system  along EASA standards evolution       Africa and Asia edit  In some countries  such as Pakistan  Thailand and several African nations  there is a strong relationship between the military and the principal national airlines  and many airline pilots come from the military  however  that is no longer the case in the United States and Western Europe  citation needed  While the flight decks of U S  and European airliners do have ex military pilots  many pilots are civilians  Military training and flying  while rigorous  is fundamentally different in many ways from civilian piloting   Canada edit  Operating an aircraft in Canada is regulated by the Aeronautics Act of      and the Canadian Aviation Regulations provide rules for Pilot licensing in Canada  Retirement age is provided by each airline  with some set to age     but changes to the Canadian Human Rights Act have restricted the retirement age set by the airlines       United States edit  In the United States in       there were         active pilot certificates      This was down from a high of over         active pilots in           Of the active pilot certificate holders  there were         Private          Commercial          Airline Transport  and         Student      In       the Air Commerce Act established pilot licensing requirements for American civil aviation  Commercial airline pilots in the United States have a mandatory retirement age of     having increased from age    in            Military edit  A U S  Air Force F    pilot in flight Military pilots fly with the armed forces  primarily the air forces  of a government or nation state  Their tasks involve combat and non combat operations  including direct hostile engagements and support operations  Military pilots undergo specialized training  often with weapons  Examples of military pilots include fighter pilots  bomber pilots  transport pilots  test pilots  and astronauts   Captain Marcel Courmes  French officer and pilot of the  nd Bombardment Group GB    August       Military pilots are trained with a different syllabus than civilian pilots  which is delivered by military instructors  This is due to the different aircraft  flight goals  flight situations and chains of responsibility  Many military pilots do transfer to civilian pilot qualification after they leave the military  and typically their military experience provides the basis for a civilian pilot s license  It was in France that the world s first bombing group was created  on November           The Voisin III were the only aircraft available for this mission  These could only carry very light loads  between        kg of bombs   the bombs were rudimentary and the aiming systems remained to be developed  Initially  the bombs were simply thrown overboard by the crew  with necessarily very limited accuracy  Nevertheless  the beginnings of tactical and strategic bombing took place in the first days of the war  Thus  the Royal Naval Air Service  RNAS  carried out bombing missions of the hangars of the airports of D sseldorf  Cologne and Friedrichhafen during the autumn of       The formation of the Brieftauben Abteilung Ostende   Ostend Carrier Pigeon Detachment   name of code of the first German bombing units  carried out bombing missions over the English Channel in December        Unmanned aerial vehicles edit  Further information  Unmanned aerial vehicle   Degree of autonomy A United States Air Force RPA pilot  Unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs  also known as  drones   operate without a pilot on board and are classed into two categories  autonomous aircraft that operate without active human control during flight and remotely piloted UAVs which are operated remotely by one or more persons  The person controlling a remotely piloted UAV may be referred to as its pilot or operator  Depending on the sophistication and use of the UAV  pilots operators of UAVs may require certification or training  but are generally not subject to the licensing certification requirements of pilots of manned aircraft  Most jurisdictions have restrictions on the use of UAVs which have greatly limited their use in controlled airspace  UAVs have mostly been limited to military and hobbyist use  In the United States  use of UAVs is very limited in controlled airspace  generally  above     ft    m and away from airports   and the FAA prohibits nearly all commercial use  Once regulations are made to allow expanded use of UAVs in controlled airspace  there is expected to be a large surge of UAVs in use and  consequently  high demand for pilots operators of these aircraft       Space edit  Picture of astronaut going through pilot training exercise  The general concept of an airplane pilot can be applied to human spaceflight  as well  The pilot is the astronaut who directly controls the operation of a spacecraft  This term derives directly from the usage of the word  pilot  in aviation  where it is synonymous with  aviator    Pilot certifications edit  Military aviation training in a Royal Air Force Nimrod aircraft Further information  Pilot licensing and certification Pilots are required to go through many hours of flight training and theoretical study  that differ depending on the country  The first step is acquiring the Private Pilot License  PPL   or Private Pilot Certificate   In the United States of America  this includes a minimum of    to    hours of flight training  the majority of which with a Certified Flight Instructor  In the United States  an LSA  Light Sport Aircraft  license can be obtained in at least    hours of flight time  Generally  the next step in a pilot s progression is Instrument Rating  IR   or Multi Engine Rating  MEP  addons  Pilots may also choose to pursue a Commercial Pilot License  CPL  after completing their PPL  This is required if the pilot desires to pursue a professional career as a pilot  To captain an airliner  one must obtain an Airline Transport Pilot License  ATPL   In the United States after   August       an ATPL is required even when acting as a first officer      Some countries carriers require use a multi crew cooperation  MCC  certificate   Life expectancy edit  There is a popular belief that airline pilots die earlier than the general population  This belief was not supported by studies of American Airlines and British Airways pilots              A hoax claiming to show an inverse relationship between retirement age and life expectancy was refuted by Boeing          However  a study of several airline pilot associations  data found evidence of higher mortality      A      study of military pilots found increased longevity  which was attributed to  generally good socioeconomic background  the positive genetic influence of long lived parents  the above average intelligence  and the health and

whose primary responsibility is ensure the safety of passengers in the cabin of an aircraft across all stages of flight  Their secondary duty is to see to the comfort of passengers  Flight attendants are also known as a steward  MASC  or stewardess  FEM   or air host  MASC  or air hostess  FEM  and are collectively referred to as cabin crew    History edit  Dutch flight attendants  Istanbul       The role of a flight attendant derives from that of similar positions on passenger ships or passenger trains  but has more direct involvement with passengers because of the confined quarters on aircraft  Additionally  the job of a flight attendant revolves around safety to a much greater extent than those of similar staff on other forms of transportation  Flight attendants on board a flight collectively form a cabin crew  as distinguished from pilots and engineers in the cockpit  The German Heinrich Kubis was the world s first flight attendant  in      aboard a Zeppelin     Kubis first attended to the passengers on board the DELAG Zeppelin LZ    Schwaben  He also attended to the famous LZ     Hindenburg and was on board when it burst into flames  He survived by jumping out a window when it neared the ground     Origins of the word  steward  in transportation are reflected in the term  chief steward  as used in maritime transport terminology  The term purser and chief steward are often used interchangeably describing personnel with similar duties among seafaring occupations  This lingual derivation results from the international British maritime tradition  i e  chief mate  dating back to the   th century and the civilian United States Merchant Marine on which U S  aviation is somewhat modelled  Due to international law  conventions and agreements  in which all ships  personnel who sail internationally are similarly documented  see Merchant Mariner s Document  by their respective countries  the U S  Merchant Marine assigns such duties to the chief steward in the overall rank and command structure of which pursers are not positionally represented or rostered   Nelly Diener  the first female flight attendant in Europe  hired in May       She was killed on the plane pictured behind her  in the July      Swissair Tuttlingen accident  Imperial Airways of the United Kingdom had  cabin boys  or  stewards   in the     s     In the US  Stout Airways was the first to employ stewards in       working on Ford Trimotor planes between Detroit and Grand Rapids  Michigan  Western Airlines        and Pan American World Airways  Pan Am         were the first US carriers to employ stewards to serve food  Ten passenger Fokker aircraft used in the Caribbean had stewards in the era of gambling trips to Havana  Cuba from Key West  Florida  Lead flight attendants would in many instances also perform the role of purser  steward  or chief steward in modern aviation terminology  The first female flight attendant was a    year old registered nurse named Ellen Church     Hired by United Airlines in          she also first envisioned nurses on aircraft  Other airlines followed suit  hiring nurses to serve as flight attendants  then called  stewardesses  or  air hostesses   on most of their flights  In the United States  the job was one of only a few in the     s to permit women  which  coupled with the Great Depression  led to large numbers of applicants for the few positions available  Two thousand women applied for just    positions offered by Transcontinental and Western Airlines in December           Washing dishes during a Qantas Airlines flight       Female flight attendants rapidly replaced male ones  and by       they had all but taken over the role     They were selected not only for their knowledge but also for their physical characteristics     A      article in The New York Times described the requirements   The girls who qualify for hostesses must be petite  weight     to     pounds  a  height   feet to   feet   inches  b  age    to    years  Add to that the rigid physical examination each must undergo four times every year  and you are assured of the bloom that goes with perfect health     Three decades later  a      New York Times classified ad for stewardesses at Eastern Airlines listed these requirements   A high school graduate  single  widows and divorcees with no children considered      years of age  girls       may apply for future consideration        but no more than     c  weight     to     d  in proportion to height and have at least       vision without glasses     Appearance was considered one of the most important factors to become a stewardess  At that time  airlines believed that the exploitation of female sexuality would increase their profits  thus the uniforms of female flight attendants were often formfitting  complete with white gloves and high heels      Flight attendant circa      In the United States  they were required to be unmarried and were fired if they decided to marry     The requirement to be a registered nurse on an American airline was relaxed as more women were hired     and disappeared almost entirely during World War II as many nurses joined military nurse corps  Ruth Carol Taylor was the first African American flight attendant in the United States      Hired in December           on    February       Taylor was the flight attendant on a Mohawk Airlines flight from Ithaca to New York  the first time such a position had been held by an African American      She was let go within six months as a result of Mohawk s then common marriage ban      Patricia Banks Edmiston became the first black flight attendant for Capitol Airlines in      following a legal complaint which resulted in the airline being required to hire her      The U S  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission s  EEOC  first complainants were female flight attendants complaining of age discrimination  weight requirements  and bans on marriage       Originally female flight attendants were fired if they reached age    or    depending on the airline  were fired if they exceeded weight regulations  and were required to be single upon hiring and fired if they got married       In       the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants  employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of           Also in       the EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant      The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in      due to the decisive court case of Diaz v  Pan Am      The Airline Deregulation Act was passed in       and the no marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the     s      The last such broad categorical discrimination  the weight restrictions      were relaxed in the     s through litigation and negotiations      Airlines still often have vision and height requirements and may require flight attendants to pass a medical evaluation       Overview edit  The role of a flight attendant is to  provide routine services and respond to emergencies to ensure the safety and comfort of airline passengers       Typically flight attendants require holding a high school diploma or equivalent  and in the United States  the median annual wage for flight attendants was         in May       higher than the median for all workers of                  The number of flight attendants required on flights is mandated by each country s regulations  In the U S   for light planes with    or fewer seats  or  if weighing more than       lb        kg     or fewer seats  no flight attendant is needed  on larger aircraft  one flight attendant per    passenger seats is required      The majority of flight attendants for most airlines are female  though a substantial number of males have entered the industry since            Responsibilities edit  This section needs additional citations for verification  Please help improve this

also titled as in flight service manager  ISM   flight service manager  FSM   customer service manager  CSM  or cabin service director  CSD  is the senior flight attendant in the chain of command of flight attendants  While not necessarily the most senior crew members on a flight  in years of service to their respective carrier   chief pursers can have varying levels of  in flight  or  on board  bidding seniority or tenure in relation to their flying partners  To reach this position  a crew member requires some minimum years of service as flight attendant  Further training is mandatory  and chief pursers typically earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and managerial role   Purser edit  This section does not cite any sources  Please help improve

crew  in a specific section of a larger aircraft  or the whole aircraft itself  if the purser is the highest ranking   On board a larger aircraft  pursers assist the chief purser in managing the cabin  Pursers are flight attendants or a related job  typically with an airline for several years prior to application for  and further training to become a purser  and normally earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and supervisory role   Qualifications edit  Training edit  Minimum entry requirements for a career as a flight attendant is usually the completion of the final year of high school  e g  the International Baccalaureate  Many prospective attendants have a post secondary school diploma in an area such as tourism and a number hold degrees having worked in other occupations  often as teachers  Graduates holding degrees  including those with studies in one or more foreign languages  communication studies  business studies  public relations or nursing can be favoured by employers          Flight attendants are normally trained in the hub or headquarters city of an airline over a period that may run from four weeks to six months  depending on the country and airline  The main focus of training is safety  and attendants are evaluated for each type of aircraft in which they work  One of the most elaborate training facilities was Breech Academy  which Trans World Airlines  TWA  opened in      in Overland Park  Kansas  Other airlines also sent their attendants to the school  However  during the fare wars  the school s viability declined and it closed around       Safety training includes  but is not limited to  emergency passenger evacuation management  use of evacuation slides   life rafts  in flight firefighting  first aid  CPR  defibrillation  ditching emergency landing procedures  decompression emergencies  crew resource management  and security  In the United States  the Federal Aviation Administration requires flight attendants on aircraft with    or more seats and used by an air carrier for transportation to hold a Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency  It shows that a level of required training has been met  It is not limited to the air carrier at which the attendant is employed  although some initial documents showed the airlines where the holders were working   and is the attendant s personal property  It does have two ratings  Group   and Group    listed on the certificate as  Group I  and  Group II    Either or both of these may be earned depending upon the general type of aircraft   propeller or turbojet   on which the holder has trained      There are also training schools  not affiliated with any particular airline  where students generally not only undergo generic  though otherwise practically identical  training to flight attendants employed by an airline  but also take curriculum modules to help them gain employment  These schools often use actual airline equipment for their lessons  though some are equipped with full simulator cabins capable of replicating a number of emergency situations  In some countries  such as France  a degree is required  together with the Certificat de formation   la s curit   Safety training certificate        Language edit  Multilingual flight attendants are often in demand to accommodate international travellers  The languages most in demand  other than English  are French  Russian  Hindi  Spanish  Mandarin  Cantonese  Bengali  Japanese  Arabic  German  Portuguese  Italian  and Turkish      In the United States  airlines with international routes pay an additional stipend for language skills on top of flight pay  and some airlines hire specifically for certain languages when launching international destinations  Carole Middleton recalled when interviewed in      that  you had to be able to speak another language  when working in the industry in the     s       Height edit  Most airlines have height requirements for safety reasons  making sure that all flight attendants can reach overhead safety equipment  Typically  the acceptable height for this is over     cm     in  but under     cm     in  tall  Regional carriers using small aircraft with low ceilings can have height restrictions      Some airlines  such as EVA Air  have height requirements for purely aesthetic purposes   Presentation edit  Singapore Girls dressed in Singapore Airlines s distinctive sarong kebaya uniforms The overall presentation of flight attendants  has transformed over the decades  Many early uniforms had a strongly military appearance  hats  jackets  and skirts showed simple straight lines and military details like epaulettes and brass buttons  Many uniforms had a summer and winter version  differentiated by colours and fabrics appropriate to the season  navy blue for winter  for example  khaki for summer  But as the role of women in the air grew  and airline companies began to realise the publicity value of their female flight attendants  more feminine lines and colours began to appear in the late     s and early     s  Some airlines began to commission designs from high end department stores and still others called in noted designers or even milliners to create distinctive and attractive apparel  During the     s  Pacific Southwest Airlines  PSA  was known for brightly coloured female flight attendant uniforms that included short miniskirts  In the early     s  the uniform changed to hotpants       Haute couture edit  In the     s  the first flight attendant uniforms were designed to be durable  practical  and inspire confidence in passengers with the first female flight attendants dressing in uniforms resembling nurses  outfits  The first female flight attendants for United Airlines wore green berets  green capes and nurse s shoes and other airlines  such as Eastern Air Lines  actually dressed female flight attendants in nurses  uniforms      However  by the     s a number of airlines were promoting their flight attendant s uniforms as evoking the refinement of haute couture  In March       Air France launched a new model designed by Marc Bohan at Dior  introducing the  Air France  model into its Haute couture collection      Hainan Airlines debuted their new flight attendant s uniforms at the      Laurence Xu Haute Couture Show at

their respective country in their female flight attendants  uniform  It was meant as a marketing strategy to showcase their national culture as well as to convey welcoming warmth and hospitality  For example  Thai Airways flight attendants are required to change from their corporate purple suits into traditional Thai costume prior to passengers boarding      Garuda Indonesia  Malaysia Airlines and Singapore Airlines female flight attendants wear modified kebayas  with batik motifs on them  For example  Garuda Indonesia s design  called  Lereng Garuda Indonesia  is inspired by the traditional batik motif of  Parang Gondosuli       Vietnam Airlines flight attendants wear red  o d i and Air India flight attendants wear a sari on all passenger flights   Uniform and makeup edit  During the mid     s  several U S  based airlines required female flight attendants to wear shoes with heels  Minimum heel heights ranged from     to   in     to    mm  mandated by US Airways      Flight attendants at times avoided censure by changing into more comfortable shoes during flights  since their supervisors were less likely to be present there      In       the Israeli airline El Al introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated      The airline s workers  union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule  Later that year the requirement was removed      Until       some female crew members on British Airways were required to wear British Airways  standard  ambassador  uniform  which has not traditionally included trousers      In       Virgin Atlantic began to allow its female flight attendants to wear trousers and not wear makeup      In       Qantas declared that it had ended uniform rules based on gender  Female flight attendants are no longer required to wear high heels  male flight attendants can wear makeup  and flight attendants of any gender can wear the same type of jewellery and have long hair in a ponytail or bun           Health conditions edit  A      study found higher instances of melanoma  breast  uterine  gastrointestinal  cervical  and thyroid cancers reported in flight attendants in contrast to the general population      Specifically  the increased cancer cases reported were seen in breast cancer       of flight crew compared to      in the general population   a     increase   cervical cancer       compared to         gastrointestinal cancer        compared to         a     increase   thyroid cancer        compared to        and higher rates of both melanoma and non melanoma skin cancers with reports of the latter increasing with every five years spent in the job      The study did not look into what causes this increase  but the authors said increased exposure to ionizing radiation from time spent in the thinner upper atmosphere  poor cabin air quality as well as disrupted sleep and meal cycles could be factors      Other studies have found increased rates of breast and skin cancer      reduced respiratory health      adverse reproductive and perinatal outcomes      musculoskeletal injuries      and higher rates of mental health conditions in flight attendants       Radiation edit  Flight attendants and crew members are known to be exposed to cosmic ionizing radiation which is a form of radiation that comes from space and intensifies as altitude above sea level increases  The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization lists ionizing radiation as a known human carcinogen      Passengers are also exposed to this type of cosmic radiation  but they spend considerably less time on average in the air than crew members  An online travel agency report found  in particular  that travelling adults in Britain spend on average     hours on flights to holiday destinations during their lifetime      In contrast  according to the US Federal Aviation Administration  a flight attendant can spend up to    hours of flight time in seven consecutive days and in some cases more      The effect of cosmic radiation on air crew members is a subject of a growing body of research          Cabin crew members are also regularly exposed to more UV radiation than the general population  which can make these workers more vulnerable to skin cancers      The U S  National Council on Radiation Protection  NCRP  reports that aircrew have the largest average annual effective dose of all U S  radiation workers       Cabin air quality edit  Poor cabin air quality is a subject of ongoing study in relation to symptoms such as headache  fatigue  fever  and respiratory difficulties among many others that have been reported by flight attendants  particularly on long haul routes  There is also much concern regarding the transmission of contagious diseases  particularly tuberculosis  An open question remains whether these complaints are due to poor cabin air quality or to other factors inherent in flights  such as lowered barometric pressure  hypoxia  low humidity  etc      Other chemical contaminants found in the cabin may include engine leakages  pesticides and flame retardants  which contain compounds that may act as hormone disruptors and increase the risk of some cancers       Sleep disruption edit  Flight attendants often have disrupted sleep cycles  They are more likely to have disruptions in their sleep patterns because they may work at night  cross time zones  and have irregular schedules  There is some evidence linking sleep disruptions to increased cancer risk      Flight attendants may also have different lifestyle behaviours related to diet  physical activity  and health care than the general population which could affect overall health and cancer risk       Secondhand tobacco smoke edit  Many of the flight attendants working today were exposed to second hand in flight smoke until      with partial smoking bans enacted in       The long term effects of this historical secondhand smoke exposure have not been well characterized       Sexual harassment edit  Flight attendants are exposed to verbal and sexual harassment      Studies in the United States and Australia have found that the vast majority  two thirds  of flight attendants experience sexual harassment in the course of their careers  including sexual assault  inappropriate touching and sexual comments both by colleagues and passengers           Flight attendants describe the verbal sexual harassment as comments that are  nasty  unwanted  lewd  crude  inappropriate  uncomfortable  sexual  suggestive  and dirty   They also report being subjected to passengers  explicit sexual fantasies  propositions  request for sexual  favours  and pornographic videos and pictures      The studies also found that     of flight attendants who experience sexual harassment on the job  chose not to report the incident because they did not think it would be dealt with appropriately or they were concerned reporting it would make the situation worse  and  their airline was not doing enough to put a stop to harassment       and that  they have not noticed any employer efforts over the past year to address sexual harassment at work        Emotional labour edit  The concept of emotional labour as the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfil the emotional requirements of a job through a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace  as opposed to the concept of emotion work  i e  the management of one s feelings in private life  was first established and linked to the profession of flight attendants by Professor Emerita of Sociology Arlie Hochschild  in her book  The Managed Heart      According to Hochschild  flight attendants do emotional labour to enhance the status of the customer and entice further sales by their friendliness      and support this effort by evoking feelings that make the  nice  display seem natural      With regard to how flight attendants are supposed to use their smile in the job  the author writes    I n the flight attendant s work  smiling is separated from its usual function  which is to express a personal feeling  and attached to another one expressing a company feeling  The company exhorts them to smile more  and  more sincerely   at an increasing number of passengers  The workers respond to the speed up with a slowdown  they smile less broadly  with a quick release and no sparkle in the eyes  thus dimming the company s message to the people  It is a war of smiles      Hochschild notes that corporate logic in the airline industry generates a series of links between competition  market expansion  advertising  heightened passenger expectations about rights to display  and company demands for acting  and when conditions allow this logic to work  private use of emotional exchange gives way to corporate use of emotional exchange      Hochschild also writes of how flight attendants are trained to control passengers  feelings during times of turbulence and dangerous situations while suppressing their own fear or anxiety      The emotional labour performed by flight attendants and cross cultural aspects of it have since been actively studied and are a topic of ongoing research                   Sponsorship and advertising edit  Air Serbia flight attendants  Tourist Fair Belgrade       Thai Airways wrap advertising on a double decker bus in Hong Kong featuring a flight attendant In the     s and     s  many airlines began advertising the attractiveness and friendliness of their flight attendants  National Airlines began a  Fly Me   campaign using attractive female flight attendants with taglines such as  I m Lorraine  Fly me to Orlando   Braniff International Airways presented a campaign known as the  Air Strip  with similarly attractive young female flight attendant changing uniforms mid flight      In the United States  many airlines had a policy such that only unmarried women could be flight attendants      as well as a mandatory retirement age of    for flight attendants because of the belief women would be less appealing and attractive after this age  Many of the women were recruited as seniors in college and in beauty pageants      In       the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants  employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of           Emirates have long sponsored international sporting events and employ their flight attendants to present awards at Wimbledon and other events           Unions edit  Flight attendant unions were formed  beginning at United Airlines in the     s  to negotiate improvements in pay  benefits and working conditions      Those unions would later challenge what they perceived as sexist stereotypes and unfair work practices such as age limits  size limits  limitations on marriage  and prohibition of pregnancy  Many of these limitations have been lifted by judicial mandates  The largest flight attendants  union is the Association of Flight Attendants  representing nearly        flight attendants at    airlines within the US      The Association of Professional Flight Attendants     represents the flight attendants of American Airlines  the world s largest carrier  APFA is the largest independent flight attendant union in the world      In the UK  cabin crew can be represented by either Cabin Crew      or the much larger and more powerful Transport and General Workers  Union  In Australia  flight attendants are represented by the Flight Attendants  Association of Australia  FAAA   There are two divisions  one for international crews  long haul  and one for domestic crews  short haul   In New Zealand  flight attendants can be represented by either the Flight Attendants and Related Services Association  FARSA  or by the Engineering  Printing and Manufacturing Union  EPMU   In Canada  flight attendants are represented by either the Canadian Union of Public Employees  CUPE  or by the Canadian Flight Attendants Union  CFAU    Discrimination edit  Originally female flight attendants were required to be single upon hiring  and were fired if they got married  exceeded weight regulations  or reached age    or    depending on the airline      In the     s  the group Stewardesses for Women s Rights protested sexist advertising and company discrimination  and brought many cases to court  In       United States President Lyndon B  Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law which prohibited sex discrimination and led to the creation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in       The EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant  For flight attendants  this meant that they had an official governing body to report offences to and allowed them to successfully challenge age ceiling and marriage bans in relation to their effectiveness as employees      In       the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants  employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of           The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in      due to the decisive court case of Diaz v  Pan Am      The no marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the     s      The last such broad categorical discrimination  the weight restrictions      were relaxed in the     s through litigation and negotiations      By the end of the     s  the term stewardess had generally been replaced by the gender neutral alternative flight attendant  Also  during the     s and     s  more men were allowed to apply as flight attendants  helping to create more usage of this term  More recently the term cabin crew or cabin staff has begun to replace  flight attendants  in some parts of the world  because of the term s recognition of their role as members of the crew   Roles in emergencies edit  Actions of flight attendants in emergencies have long been credited in saving lives  in the United States  the National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  and other aviation authorities view flight attendants as essential for safety  and are thus usually required on Part     aircraft operations      Studies  some done in light of the      Manchester Airport disaster  British Airtours Flight   M   have concluded that assertive cabin crew are essential for the rapid evacuation of aeroplanes          Notable examples of cabin crew actions include      September      edit  The role of flight attendants received heightened prominence after the September    attacks when flight attendants  such as Sandra W  Bradshaw and CeeCee Lyles of United Airlines Flight     Robert Fangman of United Airlines Flight      Renee May of American Airlines Flight     and Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney of American Airlines Flight     actively attempted to protect passengers from assault  and also provided vital information to air traffic controllers on the hijackings  as did many passengers      In the wake of these attacks  many flight attendants at major airlines were laid off because of decreased passenger loads       Other emergencies edit  This section needs additional

exception was the accident on Air Canada Flight      when the investigative board found that  misleading  reports about the fire by the flight attendant in charge  influenced the captain s decision to

country  An air traffic controller  ATC  is a person responsible for the coordination of air traffic within controlled airspace  Typically they work in area control centers or control towers  where they monitor aircraft movements and maintain direct communication with the pilots  The profession dates back to the early   th century  evolving alongside advances in aviation and radar technology to meet the growing demands of air travel   It is considered to be highly demanding and stressful  requiring continuous decision making and adaptability  often under time pressure  Factors such as unfavorable work schedules  high responsibility and the reliability of equipment further influence workload and stress levels     Despite these challenges  the role offers competitive salaries and strong job security  which are often cited as key benefits       History edit  Origins edit  Archie League on duty at Saint Louis Airport with his equipment such as signaling flags stored in a wheelbarrow  A Women s Auxiliary Air Force Corporal watching an aircraft approach from a control tower during World War II  On the table are a radio receiver  hand held Aldis signalling lamp  and log book  Air traffic controlling dates to the early     s in the UK  the first control tower was established on    February      at Croydon Airport     In      Jimmy Jeffs was issued the first Air Traffic Control License     In the US  Archie League is regarded as the first air traffic controller and was hired by the city of St  Louis in      to prevent collisions     Early controllers relied on simple visual signaling methods such as flags to communicate with pilots         Introduction of radar and radio communication edit  In      Cleveland Airport opened the first tower using two way radio communication and in      Indianapolis International Airport  then Weir Cook airport  became the first civilian airport to have radar installed     This allowed controllers to monitor aircraft positions in real time  even in poor visibility conditions  Together with radio communication with the pilots  this laid the foundation for Ground Control Approaches and later Instrument landing system  ILS      These innovations fundamentally changed the profession of air traffic controllers from guidance and ground controlling to actively guiding planes that are already in the air and making sure they land safely      Developments until today edit  Since the introduction of radar in the     s  the field of air traffic control is still undergoing major innovations  Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast  ADS B  technology is being expanded world wide providing even more accurate position information to the controller providing them with more advanced assistance systems      Future prospects edit  See also  Next Generation Air Transportation System With new technologies such as artificial intelligence emerging  efforts to automate certain tasks of ATCs began     The focus of the industry is on the development of assisting and predicting artificial intelligence tools as well as the automation of repetitive tasks rather than attempts to replace the controllers             There is a consensus among developers and airport operators that  in the foreseeable future  air traffic controllers will tend to be more of a system manager overseeing decisions made by automated systems and intervening to resolve unexpected situations  which is currently one of the most difficult tasks for artificial intelligence  making full replacement unlikely                 One challenge with partially automated workflows is the potential for skill and knowledge disintegration due to reduced daily practice  One possible solution is the use of computer based training or simulation technologies to maintain continuous learning and proficiency      An alternative approach to modernization is the implementation of fully digital remote and virtual towers  This method replaces the conventional physical control tower with remote facilities utilizing digital technologies and information dense  virtual environments to manage air traffic operations              Significant progress has already been made in this area  with the first remotely controlled tower having opened in Sweden in           Another concern is the acceptance or willingness by the controllers to use such technology  In a study with     air traffic controllers Bekier et al  found that as soon as the focus of decision making shifts away from the air traffic controller  support for the technology dramatically decreases       Roles edit  Area controllers edit  Area controllers  also called  en route  or in the US  center controllers   oversee aircraft at higher altitudes  in the en route phase of their flight surrounding busier airports and airspace  In contrast to tower controllers  their job is dominated by the discovery of conflicts      Area controllers may also handle aircraft at lower altitudes as well as air traffic around small airports that do not have their own towers or approach controllers      Area controllers are responsible for specific sectors of  D blocks of airspace with defined dimensions  Each sector is managed by at least one area controller  known as an  R side   Radar  controller that handles radio communications  During busier times of traffic  there may also be a second area controller  known as a  D side   Data   assigned to the same area in order to assist the R side Area controller      This can be done with or without the use of radar  radar allows a sector to handle much more traffic  however  procedural control is used in many areas where traffic levels do not justify radar or the installation of radar is not feasible  such as over oceans  Area controllers operate within area control centers  also known as centers or en route centers          where they are controlling high level en route aircraft  In the US  these facilities are specifically referred to as Air Route Traffic Control Centers  ARTCCs       Area controllers can also work in terminal control centers  which control aircraft climbing from or descending to major groups of airports   Aerodrome or tower edit  Controllers often work from a control tower like this one at Birmingham Airport  EnglandAerodrome or Tower controllers control aircraft within the immediate vicinity of the airport and use visual observation from the airport tower  The tower s airspace is often a   nautical mile      km  radius around the airport  but can vary greatly in size and shape depending on traffic configuration and volume      The tower positions are typically split into many different positions such as Flight Data Clearance Delivery  Ground Control  and Local Control  known as Tower by the pilots   at busier facilities  a limited radar approach control position may be needed      The roles of the positions are       Flight Data Clearance Delivery  Issues IFR flight plan clearances  obtains squawk codes for VFR aircraft  helps with coordination for GC LC  and cuts the ATIS  weather   FD CD is commonly known in the profession as the secretary of the tower  Ground  Issues taxi instructions and authorizes aircraft vehicle movements on the airport except the active runway s   controllers are not responsible for aircraft movement on ramps or other designated non movement areas  Local  Tower   Issues takeoff and landing instructions clearances and authorizes aircraft vehicle movements on or across runways  Approach  Issues instructions to aircraft who are intending to land at the airport  This involves vectoring aircraft in a safe  orderly  and expeditious manner and  if needed  stacking the aircraft at different holding altitudes  Civilian military edit  A military air traffic controller at approach control on the USS Abraham Lincoln  CVN      Civilian ATCs handle commercial and general aviation such as airliners and private jets while military controllers usually oversee airspace or airports of armed forces  Some civilian airports are part of military airports and therefore serviced by military controllers also known as joint use      In some countries all air traffic controlling is handled by the military and all controllers are soldiers     Civilian air traffic controllers  Memphis International Airport       Public private edit  Historically  most controllers were civil servants  While in many countries still have public ATC services  some have implemented mixed or fully privatized models  For example  Canada wich was the first country to fully privatize its air traffic control services  Globally  the trend toward privatization varies       Working conditions edit  Work patterns edit  Typically  controllers work between    and     minutes followed by a    minute break      Except at smaller airports with little air traffic volume  air traffic control operates nonstop  requiring controllers to work rotating shifts that include nights  weekends  and public holidays  Shift schedules are usually set    days in advance      In many countries  the structure of controllers  shift patterns is regulated to allow for adequate time off  The shift pattern often varies depending on country  facility and its location  In the US the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  regulates the hours that an air traffic controller may work  controllers may not work more than    straight hours during a shift  which includes required breaks  and must have   hours of rest before their next shift      Additionally they usually work a relatively unique rotating shift schedule  called the        Working on this schedule means rotating between two afternoon shifts  two morning shifts and a midnight shift over the course of a week       Stress edit  Many countries regulate work hours to ensure that controllers are able to remain focused and effective  Research suggests  that after prolonged periods of continuous work for more than two hours without a break  performance can deteriorate rapidly  even at low traffic levels              The International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  therefore recommends breaks at least every two hours      Sylvia Noble Tesh documented the stresses and challenges faced by air traffic controllers in her      study  The politics of stress  the case of air traffic control   published in the International journal of health services      In a study which compared stress in the general population and in this kind of systems markedly showed more stress level for controllers  This variation can be explained  at least in part  by the characteristics of the job       Career path edit  In the United States trainee controllers begin work in their twenties and retire in their fifties almost universally  This is due to an FAA requirement that trainees begin their training at the academy no later than their   st birthday  and face mandatory retirement at the last day of the month they turn         At the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation  the retirement age can be extended to         However  already experienced controllers  such as retired military air traffic controllers may qualify for appointment before    years of age          These controllers also may work longer than age    in order to be able to receive their pension          While other countries  have different regulations  a similar concept is used in many countries  such as a maximal age to start training of    in Germany       Training and qualifications edit  Requirements edit  Air traffic controllers are subject to some of the strictest physical and mental health requirements for any profession  reflecting the high responsibility   In Europe and parts of Asia  controllers must hold a Class   medical certificate             which involves evaluations of vision  hearing  physical and mental health  While in the United States there is no required certificate  candidates undergo similar assessments by the FAA  for example  air traffic controllers are required to pass a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory  MMPI  before being allowed to work in the profession              Certain health conditions such as diabetes  epilepsy  heart disease  and many psychiatric disorders  e g   clinical depression  ADHD  bipolar disorder  personality disorders  a history of drug abuse  etc       may lead to automatic disqualification or require explicit testing and waivers signed by the overseeing medical authority  demonstrating that the disorder does not impact the individuals  ability to do the job  Other conditions such as hypertension  high blood pressure   while not automatically disqualifying  are taken seriously and must be monitored by certified doctors      Controllers must take precautions to remain healthy  Additionally controllers must report all medications they are taking  even over the counter drugs to the responsible medical authority      In the US numerous drugs approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  are either banned or require an air traffic controller to apply for a Special Consideration Medical Certificate and undergo continuous monitoring of the underlying medical condition      Additionally excellent verbal communication skills are required  as controllers must be able to clearly communicate and listen to pilots  requests  even under high stress conditions          All of these rigorous standards ensure that air traffic controllers  perform their duties safely and effectively      Additionally ATCs are required to possess a certain skillset including situational awareness  organizational skills  and the ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously as well as always being thorough and paying attention to detail  Controllers must be able to make quick decisions  particularly in dynamic or high stress situations  Controllers are expected to possess excellent verbal communication skills to exchange precise information with pilots and other controllers as clarity and accuracy are essential to maintaining safety              Although local languages are sometimes used in ATC communications  the default language of aviation worldwide is aviation English  Controllers who do not speak English as a first language are expected to show a certain minimum level of competency       Education edit  Civilian Air Traffic Controllers  licensing is standardized by international agreement through the ICAO      Many countries have Air Traffic Control schools  which are often operated by the provider of air traffic services in that country or sometimes privately  These institutions provide training to individuals without any prior air traffic control experience      After the completion of academic training  the graduating student will be granted an Air Traffic Control license  which will include one or more Ratings      These are sub qualifications denoting the air traffic control discipline or disciplines in which the person has been trained  The ICAO defines five such ratings       Area  procedural  Area Radar Approach  procedural  Approach Radar Aerodrome In the United States  controllers may train in several similar specialties   Tower Ground Controlled Approach  GCA  Terminal Radar Control En route Control  both radar and non radar  This phase of training takes about     months      Whenever an air traffic controller is posted to a new unit or starts work on a new sector within a particular unit  they must undergo a period of training regarding the procedures peculiar to that particular unit and or sector  The majority of this training is done in a live position controlling real aircraft and is referred to as On the Job Training  OJT       In this phase trainees are always with a fully qualified and trained mentor or an On the Job Training Instructor  OJTI   who will also be  plugged into  the position to give guidance and is ready to immediately take over should it become necessary      The length of this phase of training usually varies between one and three years  depending on the complexity of the sector      Only once a person has passed all training stages they will be allowed to control a position alone   See also edit  Air traffic controllers

dispatcher or flight operations officer  assists in planning flight paths  taking into account aircraft performance and loading  enroute winds  thunderstorm and turbulence forecasts  airspace restrictions  and airport conditions   Dispatchers also provide a flight following service and advise pilots if conditions change  They usually work in the operations center of the airline  In the United States and Canada  the flight dispatcher shares legal responsibility with the commander of the aircraft  joint responsibility dispatch system        Operational control edit  Dispatchers usually share responsibility for the exercise of  operational control  which gives them authority to divert  delay or cancel a flight  Legal requirements known  as     CFR part      govern dispatch release in the United States     After the release of a flight  in a joint responsibility environment  the dispatcher uses sophisticated software tools to monitor the flight s progress and advises the flight crew of any circumstances that might affect flight safety  They are in constant communication with the air crew and could be contacted through phone  radio  and ACARS  aircraft communications and reporting system   Shared responsibility adds a layer of checks and balances to aircraft operation and greatly improves safety  Joint Aviation Authorities  JAR  OPS   did mandate the use of an operational control system with flight dispatchers joint responsibility flight watch  The European Union Aviation Safety Agency  EASA  has implemented operational control system requirements and continues to develop enhanced training standards for flight operations officers and flight dispatchers to align with ICAO Annex   provisions      The International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO   headquartered in Montreal  is the civil aviation branch of the UN  United Nations   ICAO states that the operator  the airline   is responsible for the operational control of its flights and only recognizes dispatch systems using flight dispatchers flight operations officers as the means to control and supervise flights in Annex    Part    Chapter    Chapter   of Annex   describes the duties of flight dispatchers flight operations officers while Chapter    of Annex   describes the training and qualification requirements for flight dispatchers flight operations officers  ICAO has updated its guidance with Document         Manual on Flight Operations Officers Flight Dispatchers Competency based Training and Assessment          which provides current standards for competency based training programs    The terms  flight dispatcher    aircraft dispatcher  and  flight operations officer  are largely interchangeable depending on the area of the world in which they are used  The term  Aircraft dispatcher  is used in the United States  while  flight operations officer  is more common in Europe and Africa  and  flight dispatcher  is typically used in Asia and the Middle East      Licensing and certification edit  A dispatcher must be certified by the aviation authority of the country in which they operate or have a base of operations  such as the DGCA in India and the FAA DOT  Federal Aviation Administration Department of Transportation  in the United States  In order to obtain a certificate  a candidate must demonstrate extensive knowledge of meteorology and of aviation in general  to a level comparable to the holder of an Airline Transport Pilot  ATP  certificate  The FAA ATP and the FAA Dispatcher  ADX  written exams are similar  For airlines operating under    CFR Part      dispatching duties and responsibilities are actually designated to  flight followers   The main difference between a flight dispatcher and a flight follower is that the latter does not share legal responsibility for the operation of a flight  In addition  a flight follower is not required to obtain a dispatcher s certificate  although he or she is usually encouraged to do so by the airline for which they work and will probably not be employed as a flight follower if they do not have the dispatcher certificate  Many countries issue licenses or certificates which are based on ICAO Annex   and   as well as ICAO DOC      D   Unfortunately not all countries have adopted a mandatory license certification and joint responsibility flight watch operational control systems  The FAA has mandated the use of flight dispatchers joint responsibility flight watch since the  Civil Aeronautic Act  was passed in       Canada has adopted a similar approach in the wake of the Air Ontario Flight      plane crash in Dryden  Ontario  in       Due to several more accidents  the FAA is lobbying the ICAO for tighter regulations  In the United States  to be eligible for an aircraft dispatcher certificate  a person must be at least    years of age and complete a minimum of     hours of approved training     As of May       the FAA incorporated updated Aircraft Dispatcher Practical Test Standards into certification requirements under    CFR Part      Airman Certification Standards and Practical Test Standards for Airmen  Incorporation by Reference   Federal Register  Federal Aviation Administration              pp               Retrieved              Legal responsibility edit  Flight dispatchers are legally     responsible for the safety of every flight they dispatch  The pilot in command of the flight holds responsibility for the other       A flight dispatcher has the legal authority to refuse to dispatch a flight if safety is in any way in question  as does the pilot in command  This is known as  Co Authority Dispatch   Because commercial decision making in an airline can conflict with the safety of a flight  a flight dispatcher s responsibilities are kept separate from the commercial aspects of an airline s operation  and as such the profession is primarily focused on the safety of a flight  all other duties are secondary     Flight dispatchers in a typical airline are generally responsible for overseeing anywhere from    to    flights simultaneously  depending on the daily ops tempo operation as some flights are much more strenuous than others as an ETOPS Air charter requires much more attention than those of a regular scheduled flight  All the while dispatchers are also constantly planning new flights while monitoring current ones  Flight dispatchers are expected to have a big picture view of weather conditions  aircraft status  fuel planning  and other operational aspects of maintaining smooth airline operations  Because of the constantly changing nature of airline operations  flight dispatchers experience a high level of stress in the workplace  as they balance operational constraints and pressures with the overriding safety mandate of the job      Load planner edit  Often  especially in larger airlines  a dispatcher will be assisted by a load planner  They must carefully plan the loading of the aircraft and do the weight and balance calculations for the aircraft  In some cargo aircraft  they have to visually inspect the loading  making sure it has been done in accordance with their instructions  When a load planner is on board the airplane as a member of the crew  he or she will be in charge of planning  loading and offloading the cargo for the duration of the flight  and is known as loadmaster      Flight follower edit  In some jurisdictions of the US  similar duties and responsibilities are designated to flight followers  The main difference between the aircraft dispatcher and the flight follower is that the latter does not share legal responsibility for the operation of a flight  During the flight  the dispatcher is required to monitor and advise the crew of changes affecting safety of flight  In flight following  ultimate responsibility and operational control of the flight rests with the Pilot in command and Director of Operations  DO   Flight followers work for the Director of Operations and are tasked with carrying out operational control functions  Flight followers are not required to attain a flight dispatcher s certificate  although they are usually encouraged to do so

checks settings on the control panel from the fold down seat he used for take off in the cockpit A flight engineer  FE   also sometimes called an air engineer  is a member of an aircraft s flight crew who is responsible for monitoring and operating its complex aircraft systems  In the early era of aviation  the position was sometimes referred to as the  air mechanic   Flight engineers can still be found on some larger fixed wing airplanes and helicopters  A similar crew position exists on some spacecraft  In most modern aircraft  their complex systems are both monitored and adjusted by electronic microprocessors and computers  resulting in the elimination of the flight engineer s position  In earlier days  most larger aircraft were designed and built with a flight engineer s position  For U S  civilian aircraft that require a flight engineer as part of the crew  the flight engineer must possess an FAA Flight Engineer Certificate with reciprocating  turboprop  or turbojet ratings appropriate to the aircraft  Whereas the four engine Douglas DC   did not require a flight engineer  the FAA type certificates of subsequent four engine reciprocating engine airplanes  Boeing     and      DC    DC    Constellation  and early two   three  and four engine jets  Boeing           early    s  DC    DC     L       early A   s  required them  Smaller twinjets  DC         BAC       Caravelle  Dassault Mercure  were never complex enough to require a flight engineer  while later large two  three  and four engine jets  Airbus A     A         Boeing      MD              and later  were designed with sufficient automation as to eliminate the need for the position    History edit  In order to dedicate a person to monitor an aircraft s engines and its other critical flight systems  the position of  flight engineer   FE  was created  The FE did not actually fly the airplane  instead  the FE s position had a specialized control panel allowing for the monitoring and control of various aircraft systems  The FE is therefore an integrated member of the flight deck crew who works in close coordination with the two pilots during all phases of flight  Traditionally  the FE station has been usually placed on the main flight deck just aft of the pilot and copilot  and close to the navigator  Earlier referred to as a  flight mechanic  on the four engine commercial seaplanes like the Sikorsky S     Martin M     and the Boeing     Clipper  the FE s role was referred to as an  engineer   much like a ship s engineer  on the first very large flying boat  the Dornier Do X  On the Do X the FE operated a large and complex engineering station similar to later large transport aircraft to monitor the twelve engines  The first US military aircraft to include a FE was the Consolidated PBY which was introduced into naval service in       The FE panel was located in the pylon between the fuselage and the wing  The FE did not have ignition  throttle and propeller controls  thus a person in the cockpit was also required to start the engines     During the war the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax bombers employed FEs  as these large aircraft employed only a single pilot  The first Allied military operation during the Second World War involving FEs occurred in February      with a Short Stirling  it was the first four engined bomber raid of the war by the RAF      Duties edit  The cockpit of a non operational four engine Ilyushin Il     with its flight engineer s station at right The flight engineer   air engineer  in the Royal Air Force  is primarily concerned with the operation and monitoring of all aircraft systems     and is required to diagnose  and where possible rectify or eliminate  any faults that may arise  On most multi engine airplanes  the FE sets and adjusts engine power during takeoff  climb  cruise  go arounds  or at any time the pilot flying requests a specific power setting to be set during the approach phase  The FE sets and monitors major systems     including fuel  pressurization and air conditioning  hydraulic  electrics  engine driven generators  auxiliary power units   gas turbine compressor air turbine motor  APU  GTC  ATM   ice and rain protection  engine and nacelle anti ice  window heat  probe heater   oxygen  fire and overheat protection of all systems  liquid cooling system  draw through cooling system  forced air cooling system  and powered flying controls  FEs are also responsible for preflight and postflight aircraft inspections  and ensuring that the weight and balance of the aircraft is correctly calculated to ensure the centre of gravity is within limits     On airplanes where the FE s station is located on the same flight deck just aft of the two pilots  all western three  and four man deck airplanes   they also monitor an aircraft s flight path  speed  and altitude  A significant portion of their time is spent cross checking pilot selections  The FE is the systems expert of the airplane with an extensive mechanical and technical knowledge of aircraft systems and aircraft performance     On some military airplanes  Lockheed C   Galaxy  Boeing E   Sentry  McDonnell Douglas KC     the FE sits behind the co pilot in the cockpit  facing outboard to operate a panel of switches  gauges and indicators or forward to operate throttles  lighting controls  flight controls  On the Tupolev Tu     the FE sits in the nose of the aircraft  On other western military airplanes  such as on the Lockheed P   Orion and Lockheed C    H Hercules  FEs sit between  slightly aft of  and  in the case of the C    A H models  slightly higher than  the pilots  On the P   Orion  E  B Mercury and E   Sentry the FE is responsible for starting and shutting down engines at the start and end of each flight  and also during in flight shutdowns which are carried out to save fuel on long range operations  In some militaries  the aircraft s FE is also authorised to make and certify repairs to the aircraft when it is away from its base  This can eliminate the need for technical repair crews to accompany the aircraft on short deployments  On civilian airplanes the FE is positioned so that they can monitor the forward instruments  pilot selections and adjust the thrust levers located on the centre pedestal  the FE s chair can travel forward and aft and it can swivel laterally    degrees  which enables them to face forward and set the engine power  then move aft and rotate sideways to monitor and set the systems panel  The FE is the aircraft systems expert onboard and responsible for troubleshooting and suggesting solutions to in flight emergencies and abnormal technical conditions  as well as computing takeoff and landing data  The FE s seat on modern aircraft has a complete range of motion  side to side  forward to aft  swivel  up and down  to accommodate the many positions required to monitor and operate the aircraft systems   Flight engineers on military aircraft are sometimes responsible for operating weapons systems like the top turret on this Consolidated B    Liberator  The basic philosophy of a three person flight deck in many flight operations  should an abnormality or emergency arise  is for the captain to hand over the actual flying of the aircraft to the first officer  co pilot   The captain and FE together review and carry out the necessary actions required to contain and rectify the problem  This spreads the workload and ensures a system of cross checking which maximizes safety  The captain is the manager and decision maker  pilot not flying  PNF   the first officer  or co pilot  is the actual flier of the aircraft  pilot flying  PF   and the FE reads the check lists and executes actions required under the auspices of the captain  There can be occasions when the roles of the pilots during an emergency are reversed  i e  the copilot becomes the PNF and the captain becomes the PF  one such example was on the A    B Series aircraft when there was a complete loss of generator supplied electrical power  whereupon the standby instruments that were powered were on the captain s side only  requiring the captain to be PF and the PNF and FE to resolve the issue  During World War II many U S  bomber aircraft incorporated a flight engineer s position  However  this position also doubled as a gunner  usually operating the upper turret  as was the case of the Boeing B    Flying Fortress  On some commercial airliners with a flight engineer  the FE is the third in command  after the captain and first officer

section  as appropriate   January        Learn how and when to remove this message  Unlike commercial pilots  the Federal Aviation Administration never set a mandatory retirement age for flight engineers  As a result  some pilots would voluntarily downgrade themselves when turning        This policy was the subject of two U S  Supreme Court cases in       when it ruled against Western Airlines that forced retirement of flight engineers based on the regulations for pilots was a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act  Earlier in the year it had rejected a policy that prevented pilots from  bumping  flight engineers from their positions upon the former reaching retirement age      Elimination edit  Flight engineer s station in a Boeing         of Swissair  Early     models were among the last commercial airliners to utilize a flight engineer  Starting in the     s  the development of powerful and small integrated circuits and other advances in computers and digital technology eliminated the need for flight engineers on airliners and many modern military aircraft  On two pilot flight deck airplanes  sensors and computers monitor and adjust systems automatically     There is no onboard technical expert and third pair of eyes  If a malfunction  abnormality or emergency occurs  it is displayed on an electronic display panel  One pilot does the flying while the other pilot starts reading and executing the quick reference handbook  QRH  to resolve the problem  Modern technological advancements in today s aircraft have reduced the dependence upon human control over systems     The most recent aircraft built with FE stations include military variants of the Boeing      such as the E   Sentry and E   Mercury  both built through          the Tupolev Tu      the final example of which was delivered in          and the Scaled Composites Stratolaunch whose sole example first flew in          The last major US passenger airline to fly aircraft equipped with a flight engineer s station was Northwest Airlines  who retired their final        s from charter service in           The final major cargo operator to employ flight engineers was FedEx Express when they retired the last of their    s in           FedEx continued to operate the DC    until the end of       all of which were originally delivered with a flight engineer s station  however all examples that were still in the fleet had been converted to MD    standard  which provided for a two crew cockpit   See also edit  Flight management system References edit

From Wikipedia  the free encyclopedia   Redirected from Flight training school  Learning to pilot an aircraft   A Canadian aeroplane flight instructor  left  and her student  next to a Cessna     with which they have just completed a lesson  Flight training is a course of study used when learning to pilot an aircraft  The overall purpose of primary and intermediate flight training is the acquisition and honing of basic airmanship skills     Flight training can be conducted under a structured accredited syllabus with a flight instructor at a flight school or as private lessons with no syllabus with a flight instructor as long as all experience requirements for the desired pilot certificate license are met  Typically flight training consists of a combination of two parts    Flight Lessons given in the aircraft or in a certified Flight Training Device  Ground School primarily given as a classroom lecture or lesson by a flight instructor where aeronautical theory is learned in preparation for the student s written  oral  and flight pilot certification licensing examinations        Although there are various types of aircraft  many of the principles of piloting them have common techniques  especially those aircraft which are heavier than air types  citation needed  Flight schools commonly rent aircraft to students and licensed pilots at an hourly rate  Typically  the hourly rate is determined by the aircraft s Hobbs meter or Tach timer  therefore the student is only charged while the aircraft engine is running  Flight instructors can also be scheduled with or without an aircraft for pilot proficiency and recurring training     The oldest flight training school still in existence is the Royal Air Force s  RAF s  Central Flying School formed in May      at Upavon  United Kingdom     The oldest civil flight school still active in the world is based in Germany at the Wasserkuppe  It was founded as  Mertens Fliegerschule   and is currently named  Fliegerschule Wasserkuppe        Licences edit  Main article  Pilot licensing and certification The International Civil Aviation Organization sets global standards for Pilot licensing that are implemented and enforced by a country s Civil aviation authority  Pilots must first meet their country s requirements to obtain a Student pilot certificate which is used for training towards a Private Pilot Licence  PPL   They can then progress to a Commercial Pilot Licence  CPL   and finally an Airline Transport Pilot Licence  ATPL      Some countries have a Light Aircraft Pilot Licence  LAPL   but this cannot be used internationally  citation needed  Separate licences are required for different aircraft categories  for example helicopters and aeroplanes  citation needed   Ratings edit  Level D simulator used for Type Conversions A type rating  also known as an endorsement  is the process undertaken by a pilot to update their license to allow them to fly a different type of aircraft     A class rating covers multiple aircraft  An instrument rating allows a pilot to fly under instrument flight rules  IFR   A night rating allows a pilot to fly at night  that is  outside of Civil

 now called Bengaluru  on    December      by Walchand Hirachand in association with Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV of Kingdom of Mysore      Walchand Hirachand became chairman of the company  The company s office was opened at a bungalow called  Eventide  on Domlur Road  The organisation and equipment for the factory at Bengaluru was set up by William D  Pawley of the Intercontinental Aircraft Corporation of New York  Pawley obtained a large number of machine tools and equipment from the United States  The Mysore Kingdom bought a one third stake in the company until April      by investing     lakh as it believed this to be a strategic imperative  The decision by the government was primarily motivated to boost British military  supplies in Asia to counter the increasing threat posed by Imperial Japan during Second World War  The Kingdom of Mysore supplied two directors  Air Marshal John Higgins was resident director  The first aircraft built was a Harlow PC        On   April       the government announced that the company had been nationalised when it bought out the stakes of Seth Walchand Hirachand and other promoters so that it could act freely  The Mysore Kingdom refused to sell its stake in the company but yielded the management control over to the British Indian Government  In      the Bengaluru factory was handed over to the United States Army Air Forces but still using Hindustan Aircraft management  The factory expanded rapidly and became the centre for major overhaul and repair of American aircraft and was known as the   th Air Depot  The first aircraft to be overhauled was a Consolidated PBY Catalina followed by every type of aircraft operated in India and Burma  When returned to Indian control two years later the factory had become one of the largest

planned in Koraput  Nasik and Hyderabad      Though HAL was not used actively for developing newer models of fighter jets  except for the HF    Marut  the company has played a crucial role in modernisation of the Indian Air Force  In       the company started manufacturing Bristol Siddeley Orpheus jet engines under licence at new factory located in Bengaluru   Production line of the HAL Dhruv at Bengaluru During the     s  HAL s operations saw a rapid increase which resulted in the development of new indigenous aircraft such as the HAL Tejas and HAL Dhruv  HAL also developed an advanced version of the Mikoyan Gurevich MiG     known as MiG    Bison  which increased its life span by more than    years  HAL has also obtained several multimillion dollar contracts from leading international aerospace firms such as Airbus  Boeing and Honeywell to manufacture aircraft spare parts and engines  By       HAL was reportedly bogged down in the details of production and has been slipping on its schedules      On   April       HAL reconstituted its Board with TS Raju as CMD  S Subrahmanyan as Director  Operations   VM Chamola as Director  HR   CA Ramana Rao as Director

Redirected from Airport slots  Permission to use airport infrastructure A landing slot  takeoff slot  or airport slot is a permission granted by a slot coordinator to use the infrastructure of an airport designated as Level    Coordinated Airport  for take off and or landing at a specific time and date     Slots should be administered by an independent slot coordinator  often a government aviation regulator such as the U S  Federal Aviation Administration     In some countries  airport operators are appointed as coordinators even though they are interested parties  Slots are allocated in accordance with guidelines set down by the Worldwide Airport Slot Board with   members each from International Air Transport Association  IATA   Airport Council International  ACI  and the Worldwide Airport Coordinator Group  WWACG   All airports worldwide are categorized as either Level    Non Coordinated Airport   Level    Schedules Facilitated Airport   or Level    Coordinated Airport    At Level   airports  the principles governing slot allocation are less stringent  airlines periodically submit proposed schedules to the administrating authority  rather than historic performance  Participation is not mandatory  but reduces congestion and non participants are penalized if the airport must later be designated level       As of the summer      scheduled season  a total of     airports in the world are Level   airports  and     are Level   airports     If an airline does not use an allocation of slots  typically     usage over six months   it can lose the rights  Airlines may operate ghost or empty flights to preserve slot allocations     To avoid pollution and financial losses caused by an excessive number of empty flights  these rules have occasionally been waived during periods of temporary but widespread travel disruption  including after the September          attacks and during the SARS epidemic  the Great Recession  and the COVID    pandemic     Maintenance of the rules forces airlines to schedule extra unnecessary flights to keep their slots  wasting fuel  a      expiration of a waiver in the United States was projected to cause        tons of carbon dioxide emissions per day     Allocated landing slots may have a commercial value and can be traded between airlines  In      Continental Airlines paid US     million for four pairs of landing slots from GB Airways at London Heathrow Airport       m each     The highest price paid for a pair of take off and landing slots at Heathrow Airport was    m  paid by Oman Air to Air France KLM for a prized early morning arrival  reported in February       A year before  American Airlines paid    m to Scandinavian Airlines     As supply is limited  slot trading became the main solution to enter Heathrow and transfers grew from    in      to     in      and over    years the average priced slot was equivalent to    per passenger       Heathrow slot valuations       Year
